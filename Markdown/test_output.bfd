Constable Jeffries knew what the answer would be before the fire inspector opened his mouth. It was another arson. That made three in two weeks and this time, two people had died.

The morning was grey, but the weather guys had promised that the sun was going to chase away the clouds later. It had rained in the night, helping the firefighters try to save the home. At least the fire hadn’t spread to either of the adjacent houses. Jeffries eyeballed the distance between them and to her eye it wouldn’t have been too hard for sparks to cross the gap.

The timbers of the home were all wet now, without a trace of smoke rising but the air was heavy with the soggy burnt smell. Jeffries rubbed her nose unconsciously as she stood in what had been the front yard of the house. The entire north end of the dwelling had fallen in, leaving the fireplace standing alone, blackened. The south end was still standing, but there would be no saving it. It was only a burnt-out shell now. That was where they had found the bodies.

The officer checked her iPad. Mr. and Mrs. Eisen. Retired. Probably had lived in the house since it was new. The record noted that Rebecca Eisen was confined to a wheelchair. Jeffries felt a stab of sadness. She could picture it: Henry Eisen trying to fight through the smoke to get his wife of… Jeffries checked the iPad. *Jesus.* Fifty-five years. Trying to get her into the wheelchair. But they hadn’t made it. Olivia Jeffries might have been a veteran on the force, but this town was more about minor complaints and maybe the odd B & E or maybe a physical assault. Car crashes, but those were on the decline too: so many roundabouts and bike lanes. *Can’t drive fast enough to crash these days. Arson and death are not what I signed up for.*

And now this made three houses burned.

“Hey Olivia. Another one.” The fire inspector said. He was a young man, easily twenty years Jeffries’ junior. He was fit and had a blond brush cut that matched is immaculately-manicured moustache. He might have been young, but Jeffries was learning that Inspector Coombs meant business.

Jeffries nodded. “Same as the other, Roy?”

“More or less. No accelerant, but started in storage. *Inside* the house, like last time.”

“Break and enter,” muttered Jeffries. It wasn’t a question.

“Not enough left of the house to say one way or the other,” said Inspector Coombs. “I’ll probably finish up in about two hours, and the report’ll be over to you later today.”

“Thanks, Roy. I appreciate it.” *For all the good it will do,* thought Jeffries. As soon as the first house fire had been flagged as suspicious, the case had come to her desk. The second one had gone to Simmons, but it had become obvious that there was a link between them. And now there was a third. All three burnt houses were within a kilometer of each other. All started from the inside. No accelerant. Gas line leaked and made things worse. Not enough left behind to let her build a case. The Fortis gas people had shut off the line as soon as they could, but the house was a loss.

“You think they came in over the fence?” asked Roy. He nodded past the burnt remains of the house towards the back of the property. There was a tall wooden fence there, with a nice lattice on the top. The trees of the adjacent natural area leaned over the fence. This whole street backed onto it.

“I’ve got three people combing the forest right now,” said Jeffries. She had already been walking the fence line. The video she took was on her iPad now. “If they climbed the fence, they did a good job of being stealthy. It rained last night.”

“Oh, yeah,” said the Inspector. He nodded, understanding. The ground was soft from the rain. Anyone jumping down from the fence would have left deep impressions in the ground. Not to mention mud climbing up again.

“We’ll go to all the houses on the street. Some of them will have those doorbell cameras. We know the time the fire started. We might get lucky,” said Jeffries. There must have been some exasperation in her tone, because Roy looked at her quickly and then looked away again. They hadn’t been lucky so far. No physical evidence that they had found had given them any leads. They were chasing a ghost. There was no denying one fact: all of the houses had backed onto the same natural area. Jeffries fought the urge to go join the officers searching the ground on the other side of the fence. They knew what they were doing. And they would be better at it than her. They had a K-9 unit. If there was a trail, they would find it.

Roy sighed as he stared at the mess. “I’ll get that report to you, Olivia.”

“Thanks Roy.”

He left to return to the site of what had been the home of Mr. and Mrs. Eisel until last night. Jeffries watched him, and then checked her watch. It was a little after nine. It was going to be a long day.

She shifted her attention to the perimeter that the police had set up. Yellow ‘Police Line Do Not Cross’ tape was strung across the edges of the property, but the police and fire vehicles didn’t stop people from coming and gawking at the mess. On a whim, Jeffries brought up the iPad with the Camera app open and quickly made a panorama of the scene. *Hey you never know,* she thought. *Sometimes the crime shows are right and the perpetrator does return to the scene.* There weren’t that many people looking on. She almost dropped her iPad when taking the panoramic photo when one person in particular caught her attention.

The person, a man who was in his middle years, was dressed in a way that couldn’t help but attract attention. Most people might be wearing some jeans or other casual pants, and a jacket on this damp and chilly morning, but not this man.

He was wearing a top hat, for one thing. A stiff, white collar poked up from a jacket and a green cravat was knotted at his throat. His jacket was fitted and fell down to his thighs in a deep dark brown. Striped pants that matched the cravat fell to highly-polished, flat-toed shoes. A walking-stick rested easily in the man’s hand as he stood at the yellow tape, surveying the damage that the evening had brought. He was dark-haired, with some silver in sideburns that were longer than fashionable and contrasting a freshly-shaven chin. His other hand held a pair of gloves.

There was no way that this man was the arsonist, in Jeffries’ opinion, but she could not stop herself from going over and speaking to him. He watched her approach but showed no apprehension. She was in plainclothes, but there was no disguising that she was investigating the crime.

She pulled out her ID and presented it to the… gentleman. “Constable Jeffries, Victoria Police,” she said as an introduction. The man scanned the ID quickly and nodded politely. He shifted his gloves to the hand holding his walking stick and fished a card out of his inside breast pocket. He handed it to Jeffries.

“Mr. Lawrence Beattie,” he said, with a slight bow. The card indicated the same name, with the addition of a middle initial “L”. Below the name, in a florid cursive font, it listed his position as “Analyst”. It didn’t say what he analyzed.

“Thank you, Mr. Beattie. May I keep this?” she asked, indicating the card.

“By all means, officer.” He nodded towards the crime scene. “A sad affair. I understand that there were… casualties… last night.”

That caught Jeffries’ attention. “How do you know that?” she asked, suddenly more interested in this odd man.

Mr. Beattie waved his gloves in the direction of the police cruiser parked down the street. A single uniformed officer was there, ostensibly to control traffic, but there was so little traffic on this little suburban street that he was standing with nothing to do. It was Jones, one of the traffic unit. Young, second year on the force.

“I spoke to your colleague only a few moments ago. I understand that the morgue removed the bodies of the poor souls who resided here just before I arrived. A very sad thing.” His voice was sincere and there was feeling in the words despite his formal manner of speaking that matched his attire.

Jeffries made a mental note to speak to Jones about talking about ongoing investigations with the public. “I see. And you are here because…” she let the sentence hang in the air as a question.

“I myself live not far from here,” said Mr. Beattie, “as you may have surmised from the address on my card.” Jeffries hadn’t actually read the address, but she did so now. A small amount of thought placed the address only two blocks away, in the direction that Jones was watching.

“Fair enough, Mr. Beattie. If you have any information pertinent to the investigation, you can contact the non-emergency number for the police and ask for me.” She was turning away, about to consider the other people who were lingering on the fringes of the crime scene, when he cleared his throat.

“I can’t help but notice that this is a third fire in the neighbourhood in a very short time,” he said. The quiet of the street was broken by the sound of a siren. Both the strange man and Constable Jeffries looked down the street at the source of the sound. An ambulance was arriving at a house further along. The ambulance parked out front of a house five lots along. As they watched, the paramedics donned surgical masks and left the ambulance, taking a stretcher from the back of the vehicle and proceeded to the house. It was on the same side of the street as the Eisel house, also backing onto the forest.

“What was that you were saying?” asked Jeffries, as her attention returned to Mr. Beattie.

“I was just observing the seeming pattern of the fires of late. But I’m sure that is not news to you.” He managed to be completely polite when he said it. There was something so mannered about his way of speaking that there was no hint of an aspersion.

“Yes, we are investigating multiple suspicious fires at this time, Mr. Beattie.”

“And the fact that they all border this little wood?” he pointed towards the back fence with his walking stick before planting it on the ground again.

“Again, noted.”

“Ah, good. I myself have cause to be in the forest from time to time. I am glad that you have noticed the geographic proximity of these events.”

“Why is that, Mr. Beattie?”

“Why, because it would ease my mind to know that our finest are ensuring that those using the forest have nothing to fear, Constable.” He gave a nod, with a hand on the brim of his hat. For a moment, Jeffries had a flash of feeling that Mr. Beattie had fallen out of some sort of PBS special, maybe a character from a Victoria mystery. She looked at his card again.

“What exactly do you analyze, Mr. Beattie, if you don’t mind my asking?”

“Not at all. Unfortunately, it’s an answer without an easy answer. It’s whatever is needed. Sometimes people pay me for systems analysis. Other times, the Universe sees fit to provide me with situations that call for analysis.” He had a twinkle in his eye as he said it, the corner of his mouth turned up into a slight smile.

*Ah, one of those,* Jeffries thought. Citizens who fancy themselves crime solvers. There were more than a few in Victoria. Something seemed to breed them here. “Okay, Mr. Beattie. Please be aware that the area directly behind this property is the site of an active investigation.”

“You mistake me. I have no desire to interfere.”

“What is it that you want, then, Mr. Beattie?” Jeffries asked.

Mr. Beattie took a moment before answering. “My interest in the forest is academic. I think that there is a non-zero chance that we will run into each other again as you conduct your investigations and I go about mine. Of course, I can’t help but be… concerned.”

“About what?”

“Well, my house is across the street. Just because all of the fires have happened backing on to the forest isn’t enough to make me feel at ease.” He waved a hand in the direction of Jones, who still had nothing to do. “You solving this would be a relief.”

“Yes, of course,” said Jeffries, grimacing. She didn’t know what it was about this man in his strange clothes and strange formality that was throwing her off so badly. His mannerisms were like waving red flags to her, but there was nothing there but sincerity. “Thank you. We might be in touch with you if we have further questions.”

Lawrence L. Beattie gave a nod of his head and returned his attention to the investigation that was going on in the charred remains.

Jeffries went back to studying the few onlookers. There were none who jumped out like that man did. Just the neighbours looking in on the action. Most looked tired. As they might, given the noise that the firefighters would have made the night before. There were more women than men and some of them shepherded young children with them.

The police officers who had been working behind the fence came to report. They hadn’t found anything. The dog hadn’t found anything either. The rain from the night before could have washed away any traces, but under the trees it was still mostly dry. There should have been a trail if anyone had entered the Eisel property from the back.

They dog and his handler left in a cruiser. By the time Jeffries’ attention returned to the onlookers, the crowd had dwindled. There was no sign of the odd gentleman. The siren picked up again down the street as the ambulance sped off in the direction of the hospital.

By noon, the investigation was winding down. There were no clues as to the identity of the arsonist.

## Chapter One: Research Student

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick Jackson stood on the sidewalk, looking at the address in the email and at the house in front of him. There was no question as to the address: it was clear in the email, and the house was well-marked. Large brass numbers topped the gate that barred entrance to the  front yard. The problem was that he was expecting some sort of an office building, not an elaborately manicured house in suburban Victoria.

He slid his phone back into his pocket and unclasped the strap on his bike helmet, pulling it off and tousling his hair. He leaned his bike, a vintage Raleigh that he’d restored himself, up against the low brick wall surrounding the property.

“Okay, think,” he muttered to himself. Nick tended to do that when faced with a knotty problem. “What’s going on?”

One week previously, he had found a new co-op job opportunity in the Biology department at the University of Victoria. It had been some time since a good one had come through, and he’d been starting to worry that he wouldn’t have a position for the summer. This one had been ideal: it was looking for someone who was specializing in etymology and who liked working outdoors. The best part was that it was located in Victoria. He wouldn’t even need to get a bus pass: he could ride from his place in just over thirty minutes. The pay was only mediocre for a co-op, but Nick wouldn’t have to move.

The interview had been remote, but then almost everything was these days, with the pandemic. The interview had come within two days and by the end of the week, his interviewer, a Mr. Beattie, had called him to congratulate him on earning the position. Today was his first day.

Nick had punched the address into his phone and started riding, listening to the directions. It was only in the last kilometer that the route had taken him here, to a place where the houses were all forty or fifty years old, and there was not an office in sight.

He looked up and down the street again, but there was nothing to be seen, except for stuccoed houses, mature trees and cars parked along the curb. This property, number 221, was larger than the others that he could see, and it was better-kept, but it was not the sort of place he expected to have as a co-op workplace.

Shrugging, Nick tried the gate, but it was latched. There was a brass-plated megaphone-shaped thing next to it, and a short chain dangled from it. Short of hopping the fence, it looked like that was his next move.

He pulled the chain. There was an immediate buzzing sound coming from the megaphone. He assumed it was some sort of a speaker and microphone, so he put his face closer.

A woman’s voice spoke from the megaphone. “Beattie Analytics, how can I help you this morning?”

“Um, hi. My name is Nick Jackson, I… ah… I have this address. It’s supposed to be my first day?” He winced at the sheer awkwardness. The fact that this was *Beattie Analytics* had to be a good sign that he was at the right place.

“Yes, Mr. Jackson. I have you here. You are expected. Please come to the front door.” The megaphone went dead and a moment later there was a metallic *clack* as the gate unlatched. Nick gave it an experimental push, and it swung back easily. Nick was impressed with the smoothness of the motion. As someone who had spent a lot of time working with metal and grease, he could appreciate the work and upkeep that represented.

He grabbed his bike and maneuvered it through the gate, letting it swing shut behind him. The brick wall surrounding the yard was only waist-high with ironwork above, so he could still see the road easily, but something about being inside had changed the feel of the air. Everywhere he looked, the gardens were immaculate and geometric. Shrubs were trimmed into ideal forms, and he could not spot a single dead leaf or wilted flower. A crushed gravel path ran from the gate up to where the curving drive ended in front of the house. Trees fringed the space, giving the illusion of distance to the neighbours. It had the feel of an estate, instead of a lot in the suburbs.

The house itself was certainly unlike the others on the street. Immediately, Nick concluded that this must have been the original home when the area had been subdivided. The foundation was built from rounded stone, with the main structure being built of cut stone above. A myriad of narrow windows decorated the front, and the roof peaked in several places, including a structure that looked like a turret on one corner. Whoever had designed this house had aimed to make a small castle. The front door was large and double, with an arch of stone above it. A brass lamp dangled on a chain from the arch to illuminate it at night. Wide stairs climbed up to the doors.

Nick’s feet crunched on the gravel. At the bottom of the stairs, he leaned his blue Raleigh against the foundation stone. There wasn’t anywhere else to park it that he could see. He quickly threaded his lock through the frame and the front wheel. He wanted the bike to be there when he came back. Hastily, he untucked his pant leg from his right sock and put on a face mask. It was time to make a good first impression.

He climbed the stairs, with his backpack over one shoulder and his bike helmet in hand. As he approached the doors, they opened.

A woman of her early middle years was there. Her hair was black and swept neatly back and to her shoulders. She wore a long-sleeved blue blouse that buttoned up the front and had a soft collar. It was paired with a long skirt that swept the floor where she stood. She wore a light-blue mask that appeared to be silk and set off her outfit perfectly. Nick suddenly felt underdressed in his golf shirt and jeans. But he was an undergrad student. He only had limited means.

“Hi, I’m Nick,” he said.

“Welcome, Mr. Jackson,” said the woman. “I am Miss Patterson, Mr. Beattie’s assistant. I will show you in.” She backed away, to allow Nick to enter.

“Um, okay,” said Nick. “Nice to meet you, M—Miss Patter…”

“Patterson.” She didn’t say it coldly, but there was a formality to it that took Nick off guard.

Nick stepped inside the house and stopped dead.

It wasn’t just the outside that was like a castle. Every part of the interior that Nick could see was… fabulous. The floor was a hardwood that shone darkly. Rich, woven rugs led the way further into the hall. The walls were paneled in carved wood, age-darkened with decades of polish. A crystal chandelier hung overhead, held aloft by a thick brass chain. A red and gold patterned carpet ran up a curving staircase to the second level. Large paintings hung on the walls, showing countryside scenes.

Once before, Nick had gone to visit Craigdaroch Castle. It was like he’d been teleported there when he had entered the house. Involuntarily, he looked back out the door, and he could see the rear wheel and a bit of blue steel frame of his Raleigh parked outside. He hadn’t teleported.

“Should I take my shoes off?” he asked. He didn’t want to know how much the rugs cost. His shoes were clean, but his mom would kill him if he got dirt on the rug back home.

“I should think not,” said Miss Patterson. She closed the door and then swept by. “Follow me, please.”

The laws of physics were still in force, because while it was a large house, it was not a castle. A short walk down the hall, through a set of brass-handled doors, another narrower hall, and they broke out of the Victorian decor and into a brightly-lit white office space. There were three desks, and computer monitors on all of them. Modern office chairs sat on a low-pile office carpet.

Nick let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. It was something normal.

“What—what was…” he gestured back the way they had come.

“Mr. Beattie has a signature style,” said Miss Patterson. “It is a passion of his. But please don’t let it interfere with your work here. Mr. Beattie will be with us in about an hour. We can be finished all of your paperwork before then.”

Miss Patterson led Nick to a chair opposite her desk and proceeded.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

If the formality of Miss Patterson caught Nick offguard, the appearance of Mr. Beattie left him speechless. His parents had always been fans of Masterpiece Theatre and Sherlock Holmes mysteries on PBS, and Mr. Beattie would have not been out of place in any of those period dramas. He was older, maybe forty, with a widow’s peak that was accentuated by his medium-length haircut and long sideburns. They weren’t quite mutton chops, but it was a near thing. A silk waistcoat accentuated his slim physique, and an old-fashioned high collar framed his narrow face. A golden chain looped into a front pocket on his waistcoat, and Nick was ready to bet that a pocket watch was making the small bulge in the pocket. A royal purple cravat and matching face mask finished off the ensemble.

“Master Jackson,” said Mr. Beattie. He made no motion to shake hands, but that was pretty normal at the moment. He gave a slight bow and nod of the head. Nick had scrambled to his feet and jerked a quick bow in return.

“Mr. Beattie, thank you so much for the opportunity.”

“Think nothing of it, young man. I feel exceptionally lucky to have someone with your skills to assist in this project. It seems as thought there is a sense of urgency to our work, and to find you at such short notice seems providential.”

He turned to Miss Patterson. “Everything in order, Miss Patterson?”

“Quite, Mr. Beattie. Everything is squared away, and he has a login on the computers. He is ready to go.”

“Fantastic. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?”

Nick felt two pairs of eyes on him. He wanted to ask something really smart, to show that he was ready for anything and that they’d hired the right person, but he was coming up blank. He had so many questions, but they weren’t exactly related to the job. He could ask three questions just about that cravat.

“I guess not, M-Mr. Beattie,” Nick managed. “I’m curious as to what the project is. And why time is important. What skills of mine?”

“No questions, but then asks three, that’s capital,” Mr. Beattie said with a smile. “If Miss Patterson has gone over the gory details of hours and pay and all that…” he waited for a curt nod from the woman, “…then we can get to the business at hand. You were selected because you expressed an interest in entomology.”

“I’m making it my specialty,” said Nick. “I’ve always been fascinated.”

“The lives of the very small are worth studying,” mused Mr. Beattie. “There are entire worlds in every back yard. Life hiding under our noses, as it were.”

“How long have you studied insects, Mr. Beattie,” asked Nick. He looked around again, and noticed for the first time that there was no sign of any lab equipment at all. He would have expected to see a dissecting microscope at least. *Maybe there’s another room somewhere.*

“Ah, it’s not my main business, but for the moment, I have a particular interest. Let’s put that aside for the time being.” He shared a quick glance with Miss Patterson. “The basic parameters of our study is that I suspect an invasive species has established a colony in the natural area that exists just beyond the homes on the opposite side of the street.” He gestured in the general direction of the front of the house. Involuntarily, Nick looked, but there was no way to see anything.

“There has been some evidence of it, but to my knowledge no one has identified the species or how much we need to worry about the health of the forest and the surrounding areas.”

“What evidence?” asked Nick.

“Again, a good question, but immaterial,” replied Mr. Beattie. “The purpose of our study is to locate and identify the species. What we need to do is start planning our survey. The natural area is over ten square kilometers. We will need to work efficiently and quickly.”

They moved to a large work table, where Miss Patterson unrolled a large paper map that showed a section of Victoria. The natural area was an easily spotted green area, and at the map’s scale it was large enough to see a fair bit of detail. Nick leaned in as Mr. Beattie described the area and its history.

“It’s a mix of Douglas fir and Garry Oak,” he began. Nick was fascinated as he listened to the man describe in a few words the nature and geography of the forest. It had some running water that dried in the summer, but the winter was very wet.

In twenty minutes, he was finished, and he waited expectantly for Nick to say something.

“Can we walk it?” Nick asked.

“Of course. That is an excellent suggestion. And then what?”

“And then what?”

“You are the entomologist. How would you suggest we construct our strategy?” Mr. Beattie waited.

“Wait, I’m a biology student. I like bugs and I’m learning about them. Are you sure you want me to…” he trailed off as he saw the expressions on their faces.

“Yes, I am quite sure,” said Mr. Beattie. “I would trust an enthusiastic amateur in this much more than a seasoned professional. I expect that our findings will be extraordinary.” His eyes glittered with excitement.

“Well, let’s go walk it,” said Nick with a grin.

## Chapter Two: Intensive Care

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora kicked at the floor, spinning her chair around. When the rotation slowed, she kicked again, speeding the spin. She was starting to get dizzy, but she didn’t care.

Life was on pause. It had been for days now. Her curly auburn hair cascaded in front of her face like a curtain, helping to shut out the view of her bedroom and the world in general. The world could burn for all she cared.

All the isolation. All the precautions. So much effort trying to stay safe during a pandemic, and then a child brought the virus into her father’s classroom. Three other kids were positive now, but it was her father who was paying the price.

The thought made Aurora flinch away from reality again. If she worked really hard, she could think of nothing at all. It wasn’t easy for her, but she was trying. Normally, she and her father did nothing but think and share their thoughts with each other. Sometimes, she thought that her father was her soulmate. It wasn’t a creepy thing, but they had a connection that made him the most important person in the world to her. And it had been six days since he’d been taken away in an ambulance.

Six days. They hadn’t been allowed to visit. Mom had gone once, but had only been able to see him for a moment, with full protective clothing, mask and face shield. At least that’s what Mom had told them when she got home. She had put on a mask of a different kind when she sat Aurora, Jimmy and Seve down and told them about her visit. But the mask had come off later and Aurora had heard Mom crying in her room after the lights were out.

The problem was thata Aurora knew everything there was to know about the coronavirus. Her insatiable curiosity hadn’t let her stop when the virus raced around the world, ravaging countries like Italy first. When it had arrived in Canada, she could sense the concern in her parents’ behavior, and she could not blame them. She knew all about r-values and transmission vectors.

“Just wait for the vaccine,” her father had told her many times. She had a poster of Kati Kariko on her wall. The woman’s unlikely status as the potential savior of the world with her mRNA research had inspired Aurora. She had applied to the University to study biology in the fall and had been admitted already. She had already started simulating the mRNA processes in some custom code on her computer. Aurora was a girl who was ready to take on the world and contribute in a big way.

But now life was paused.

Dad was in the ICU. That was a bad sign. The statistics were still in his favor. He was in his forties and healthy. No underlying health conditions.

But things had gone from fine to terrifying in hours. First he had spiked a fever. And then his oxygen saturation had taken a dive. The virus had attacked his lungs like a diving raptor. Within hours the ambulance had come.

The whole family was quarantined. The test results were supposed to come today. Mom had had a rapid test to visit Dad, and that had been negative.

Aurora held up her hand and examined it. The pale flesh, rosy with the blood vessels just under the surface of the skin. Were there virus particles mixed in with that blood? It chilled her knowing that she could be sick but showing no symptoms. By the time you had symptoms, you would have been shedding viruses for days, infecting those around you. She tucked her hand under her butt, trying to stop thinking again.

Quarantine was hard, but it was harder for Jimmy and Seve. Jimmy was fifteen and Seve was eleven. Jimmy was vaccinated, but then so had Dad been.

As if on cue from her thoughts, Aurora heard a whirring sound in the hall. It approached, gaining volume.

“Jimmy, Mom said no drones in the house!” Aurora shouted. She didn’t stop spinning her chair. The whirring continued to get closer. Aurora put a foot down, stopping her chair facing the door of her room. The room was spinning, but she didn’t need to be steady to see the red and blue blinking lights of the small quadcopter that was edging its way into her room. She hadn’t closed the door. *I should have,* she thought.

It was one of her brothers’ smaller drones. This one was actually made for indoor use, so her brothers were technically correct to ignore her. Sometimes Jimmy tried flying the racing one inside, and that always ended in something broken.

“If you’re bored, I’m sure Mom can find you some chores to do,” threatened Aurora. Having two little brothers often meant that she was the Mom-delegate when Mom herself wasn’t available. The drone pulled back out of Aurora’s room.

“C’mon, Rora,” came Seve’s voice from the hall. “You gotta do somethin’ fun.”

“No, I don’t gotta,” she replied. She tried to keep the bitterness from her tone, but was not successful. She kicked her chair into motion again.

The drone came all the way into her room. “This is my sovereign airspace,” growled Aurora. “Don’t make me shoot the invader down.”

“Ha! That would be great!” said Seve. He was at the door now, holding the remote for the drone. He was still short, with the same big eyes that people told Aurora that she had, and the same color hair. But where Aurora’s was a wild, untamed mess, Seve’s was cut into a short, dark red buzz. He was grinning as he watched his big sister while still piloting the drone. It began to make circuits of her room.

“Watch the mobile,” Aurora grumbled. She had a model of the solar system hanging in one corner of her room. It hadn’t happened yet, but there was a near-certainty that on an infinite timeline that one of her brothers’ drones would tangle themselves in it.

“You aren’t workin’?” asked Seve. That was what he called it when Aurora was building the molecular models on her laptop.

“I don’t feel like it.”

“You always feel like it.”

“Yeah, well I don’t!” Aurora tried to control her voice. She just wanted Seve to go away and leave her alone. “I just want this horrible waiting to end.”

The phone rang downstairs. Seve’s drone wobbled dangerously close to the model solar system, but it stayed clear. Mom must have been waiting near the phone, because it didn’t ring a second time. Her voice was muffled.

Part of Aurora wanted to ignore the sounds coming from downstairs. Whatever the news was,  she would find out soon enough. But she couldn’t help herself and her ears strained to hear any words, to pick up any tone.

“What do you think…” started Seve.

“Shh! Can’t you land that thing?” She pointed at the hovering quadcopter. Aurora strained to listen, but all she heard was the phone receiver being returned to the cradle. She felt a pang of relief. *Whatever it was…*

Then she heard the distinctive ringtone of a FaceTime call. It was also coming from downstairs. It had to be Mom’s phone. Aurora’s eyes met Seve’s.

“Dad calling!” exclaimed Seve. He hit the ‘emergency land’ button on the remote. The drone fell out of the air, bounced off the corner of Aurora’s desk and hit the floor. Seve was already out of sight and pounding down the hall. Aurora jumped out of her chair and followed as quickly as she could. She dodged the laundry hamper and a soccer ball, before taking the stairs two steps at a time. She heard Mom’s voice in the living room and skidded to a stop just inside the entrance.

Mom was holding her phone up to her face, but she was having trouble keeping it steady. Tears leaked from her eyes, and Aurora could see that she was trying to keep it together.

“Mom?”

Mom blinked her eyes and tried to smile. “Come over here kids.” Her voice was rough and cracking. “Call your other brother to say… hello.”

Aurora moved uncertainly around to where her mom was sitting on the couch. She sat down next to her. Her mom was radiating warmth.

Dad was on the little screen. The light was sickly fluorescent. It only made things worse. Dark circles shaded his eyes and his lips looked blue. His skin was pale and his hair looked like it hadn’t been washed in a while. An oxygen line ran under his nose.

He cracked a lopsided smile when he saw his daughter on the screen. He took two shallow breaths before gasping out words.

“Hi Aurora Fay,” he said before another quick inhalation.

“Hi Dad,” said Aurora. She tried to ignore the sniffles beside her from Mom. “What’s up?”

“I’ve only got a little time, Miss.” A labored breath. “Are your brothers there?” Mom turned the phone so that it faced Seve. He was standing, confused near the coffee table.

“Hey little man.” A gasp. “I hope I’ll get to see you soon.”

“Dad, what’s happening?” asked Aurora.

“They… they have to put your father on a ventilator, Aurora.”

“What’s that?” asked Seve. “A ventibator?”

“Is it that bad?” asked Aurora. Mom turned the phone back to Aurora. She could see tears in his eyes. He nodded. His chin was twitching. Beside her, Mom was now weeping softly. Dad tried to say something, but he couldn’t get it out. He bit his lip.

*This is bad*, Aurora thought. Seve might not understand what was happening, but he could sense the emotions and his eyes were turning red and watery. Inside, Aurora searched for tears. But she only found a cold, dark hole inside her.

“What is it?” repeated Seve, his voice cracking.

No one else could speak, so Aurora did. “The virus has damaged Dad’s lungs, Seve. He can’t get enough oxygen. He needs a machine to breathe for him.” She swallowed. “Once he has a tube in him, he won’t be able to speak. This might be good bye.”

Mom immediately made a shushing sound, but wasn’t composed enough to say anything.

“JIMMY!” Aurora yelled, causing Seve to jump. “GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE!”

Aurora returned her attention to the little screen. Her father was still trying to put on a brave face.

“You’ll be okay, Dad,” she said.

“Isn’t that what I’m…” a gasp, “…supposed to say?” he asked.

“I’ll be fine, Dad. You get better.” Aurora smiled, but she felt nothing. She still was cold inside.

Her other brother, Jimmy, showed up in the doorway to the front hall. He was swiping on his phone, only paying half attention to what was going on. “What do you want, Rora?”

“Say goodbye to Dad. You won’t get another chance.” She levered herself up from the couch and strode out of the room. If she bumped Jimmy with her elbow as she went by, it was almost unintentional.

“Aurora!” she heard her mother say, but she was done. Days of waiting and the best the doctors could do was jam a breathing tube down his throat. This wasn’t the end. But she could not be in that room another minute. She slammed her foot down on each step as she climbed back up the stairs. She slammed the door behind her when she was in the room.

She hated that the world had done this to her father. She hated that medicine and science had let him down. She hated that she didn’t feel anything except hate.

“Lunid would have been able to do something!” she said to the room.

As soon as she did, he clapped her hands to her mouth in shock. She had agreed with herself that she would never mention that again.

## Chapter Three: Invisible Laughter

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Ellie Patterson sipped her coffee across the table from Lawrence. They were in the morning room of the house, ready for the day to start. It was a day that she was looking forward to: the boy Nick was going to start the survey of the forest, and she and Lawrence were going to accompany him. In three years, she had learned to accept that Lawrence Beattie was a man of passion, and when one grabbed him, he was unable to focus on other things.

“Mr. Beattie,” she said, putting her china mug down on the gold-rimmed saucer. She went to smooth her skirt, but today she was wearing a set of pleated trousers. It was much more practical if they were going to have an expedition into the wild.

Lawrence looked up from his computer. He had been monitoring the news, both local and technical on the screen. Like everything else in his life, it had the trappings of an era gone by. In this case it was like an artifact of a time that never really existed. The Victorians hadn’t had computers, but if they did, perhaps they would have been finished in polished wood and brass like this one was. He had had it made to his specifications and it was yet another accessory to the way he lived his life.

“What is it, Miss Patterson?” Even alone as they were, he insisted on the formality.

*Where to begin?* “Our work today, with Mr. Jackson. I would like to know what we are going to accomplish.”

“Today? Not much, I imagine.” He closed the computer’s screen down and hooked the brass latch with his thumb. “It’s a big forest. It will take time.”

“*What* will take time? You have shelved three other projects to suddenly canvas this forest for insects.” Ellie tried to keep her voice perfectly level, but even she could hear the strain. She shifted her position and folded her hands in her lap. “I have spoken to your clients and explained that their projects will be delayed, but I could not say for how long. They were… displeased.”

Lawrence pushed his chair back and crossed his legs, steepling his fingers at his chin. He studied her, but Ellie knew that he was not upset with her for the question. He had always encouraged her to question things he did. They had made a good team for years now. His consultancy was successful, even though he didn’t need the money. It was always about the puzzle, the challenge with Lawrence.

“There was death yesterday. On the far side of the wood. A baby in its bath. The mother was there, but was called away. By the time she returned, the baby had drowned. In an inch of water.”

Ellie shifted on her chair. “Tragic.”

“It is.” Lawrence sighed. “But it is not isolated, as you know. There have now been six tragedies. The correlation with the geography of the forest cannot be denied.” They had been over this before. A map copy laid on the table in Mr. Beattie’s study, marked with pins where each new event had occurred.

“But insects?”

“Let’s let our entomologist answer that one. Trust me.”

A chime rang. The pitch told Ellie that it was the front gate. It had been opened. Nick was here. It was time to go. They finished their drinks and then Ellie led the way downstairs. By the time they reached the offices, Nick was there. His dark hair was tied back at the nape of his neck, making a bushy ponytail. He smiled, his teeth brilliant white against his dark skin. Ellie had to admit that the young man was easy to look at. He had high cheekbones and full lips. Maybe if she was ten years younger.

“Are you ready, Miss Patterson, Mr. Beattie?”

“We are. Lead the way, Mr. Jackson,” said Lawrence.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick still felt weird telling the other two what to do. In the two days that he had been working for Mr. Beattie, it had become clear to the young man that the older man had a mind from which nothing escaped. In the evening after the first day he had searched the Internet for more information about this man who was now taking his lead.

Lawrence Lee Beattie was rich. That much was obvious. His website was vague, but it invited potential clients to bring challenges. In the past, Beattie Enterprises had been a system design consultancy. Nick had compiled a short list of the companies who had Lawrence Beattie to thank for their computer systems. Now, it appeared that Mr. Beattie was partially retired from that work, but now it was harder to figure out what Beattie Enterprises did.

It didn’t walk around forests at the direction of a third-year undergrad student.

And yet, here they were. Nick had devised a search grid and they all had species identification software on the tablets in their hands. The GPS on each unit tracked where they were and logged every observation to a database. If any of them logged a species of insect that was not native to Vancouver Island it would be flagged. He was proud of the system, and Miss Patterson had procured the tablets and the software as soon as he had suggested them.

It didn’t make any sense to Nick. He kept expecting someone to break the illusion and then he would find out what was really going on.

“Do you think we should split up? We would cover more ground that way,” asked Nick.

“I don’t think that is wise,” Mr. Beattie said quickly.

*It’s only a little forest,* thought Nick. *Not much that could happen.*

“Okay then, let’s get started. I’ll take the grid square one to the west. When Mr. Beattie looked alarmed, he continued. “It’s only ten meters. We can see each other easily.”

It took some time for all three to be proficient with the species identification app, but once they got it, they started moving more quickly. They all had steel picks and took their time, probing the leaf litter on the forest floor and under the surface and the bark of trees. Truthfully, this was the first time Nick had ever tried to do a comprehensive survey before. They said that there were 400 million insects per acre on Earth, and soon Nick believed that. They didn’t have to count insects, but any time they saw any new species they needed to identify it. The machine learning AI in the app was awesome. Soon Nick was able to identify the species faster than the tablet, though.

As they were working, Nick watched Mr. Beattie. He was dressed like he was on an old-fashioned safari, complete with a pitch hat. He used his tablet, but he was also spending a lot of time using a small pair of binoculars, peering into the forest canopy.

Nick shrugged. It wasn’t his to criticize. In a world that made sense, Nick would be told to do all the work himself. Besides, once they finished a ground survey, they might have to add a survey of the canopy. That made Nick start to think about how he might approach that. It all depended on how much money Mr. Beattie was willing to spend to find his invasive species.

Either way, this was going to look good on a resume. He had had his doubts on the first day, but he was getting leadership experience, field experience, data collection experience.

He started humming to himself as he smiled.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Abbie was having a great morning. Her best friend, Gwen, was playing at her house today. Gwen’s mommy had come to visit her mommy, and so she got a play date today. The mommies were in the sun room having tea, and so were they. They were on the patio, with her little tea table.

Abbie was in her best party dress, and she had let Gwen have one of the dresses from her dress-up trunk. It was a blue dress with yellow flowers on the lace around the neck. The wide-brimmed hat and long gloves made Gwen look like a lady. Her favorite stuffies were here too, all dressed up. Mr. Unicorn had a tie on, and Mrs. Potato Head had her sparkly purse and high-heel shoes. Once, Abbie had tried on Mommy’s high heel shoes and had gotten in a lot of trouble. Someday she would have her own and then she would look like a lady, too.

She had wanted to go swimming in the pool today, but Mommy had told her that the water was too cold still. They had to wait until hot summer weather. Abbie looked longingly at the pool, behind the metal safety fence.

“More tea, Mr. Tiger?” she offered the plastic teapot to her orange and black striped friend. Of course, Mr. Tiger didn’t answer, but she imagined that he did. She tipped the teapot over his teacup, and waited until the right amount of imaginary tea filled his cup.

“Would you mind?” she asked Gwen.

“Of course,” said Gwen. She picked up the sugar bowl and put two pretend sugar cubes in Mr. Tiger’s cup and then stirred. “Does he take milk?”

“Oh, no,” replied Abbie. “It upsets his stomach.” Gwen put the milk pitcher down.

Abbie took the second-last cookie and offered the plate to Gwen.

“I shouldn’t,” said Gwen. “I’m watching my figure.” That was something that mommies said. Abbie looked at the cookie in her hand and sighed and put it back on the plate. Mommy had actually given them a plate with two Oreos each.

*Maybe I’ll eat it later,* Abbie thought.

“After tea, we should put on a play,” said Gwen.

“Ooh! That’s a great idea!” exclaimed Abbie.

“I’d like to do that, too!” said Mr. Tiger.

Abbie stopped cold, and so did Gwen. Gwen’s eyes were open as wide as they could go. They both stared at Mr. Tiger.

“You want to be in the play?” asked Abbie, tentatively. To her amazement, Mr. Tiger’s soft neck bent a little.

“Yes, I would like to. Do you mind?” Mr. Tiger only had a sewn-on mouth, and it didn’t move as he spoke. But there was no mistaking that the voice was coming from him.

“Your voice isn’t like I imagined, Mr. Tiger,” said Abbie. It was higher-pitched and had an accent. She didn’t know what kind, but she didn’t expect her tiger to have one.

His head turned until his glass eyes fixed on Abbie. “It’s the voice that’s in your heart. I’ve always had it, and today you get to hear it.” He got up from his little chair, tottering on his stubby hind legs. “This is a special day and a special party. Let’s not waste a single minute,” he said.

Abbie smiled, and looked at Gwen. Her friend still looked shocked, but when their eyes met, she had a little smile, too.

Mr. Tiger was walking stiff-legged away from the tea table. “Let’s go out here where we have more space,” he said. His short arm waved for the girls to follow. “We need a stage for our play.”

“Yes, I want to play the princess,” said Gwen. “You can be the tiger that rescues me.”

“Hey, *I* want to be the princess,” said Abbie. “He’s my tiger, he can rescue me. You can be the evil stepmom who is holding me prisoner.”

“No way!” retorted Gwen. She stopped walking and crossed her arms over her chest.

“Girls, you can both be princesses. Held prisoner by the evil unicorn king.” With that, Mr. Unicorn also got up from the table and trotted jerkily past them and ran laps around Mr. Tiger.

“Oh, that sounds better!” said Abbie.

“We need a big stage. This is going to be a big play,” said Mr. Tiger. He lurched into motion again. He reached the gate to the fence around the pool.

“We can’t go in there!” As she watched, Mr. Tiger reached up and worked the latch on the gate. It was a complicated one. Abbie didn’t know how it worked. Her Daddy had told her many times never to try to open it. The pool was a special place and she should only go there when Mommy or Daddy was there. The gate creaked open. Abbie looked back. She could see Mommy, laughing with Gwen’s mom. She was just inside the sun room. That would count as Mommy being there, wouldn’t it?

Mr. Tiger and Mr. Unicorn ran through the gate.

“But we can’t have our play in there!” said Gwen. “There’s no room.”

“Sure there is. Look at this nice big play area,” said Mr. Tiger. His arm swept out, indicating the blue expanse of the pool cover. It was a bubbly plastic, floating on the top of the water. “See the bubbles? It floats. We can play on it, like a trampoline.”

Abbie got really excited. She’d always wanted a trampoline. They looked like so much fun.

“See?” Mr. Unicorn and Mr. Tiger both ran out onto the pool cover. Their feet barely made a dent in the surface. The cover moved up and down in a way that looked like a lot of fun to try.

Inside, Beth, Abbie’s mom, was about ready to use the washroom. The tea was going through her. It had been a long time since she’d had some good “grown up” time. She really should invite Jazz and Gwen over more often. They didn’t live that far away.

“Do you need anything?” she asked as she got up from the white-painted wicker chair. The sun room was living up to its name this morning. She was going to have to open the vents to get a cool breeze in.

“No, I’m fine,” said Jazz. She took another sip of her tea.

“Okay, I’ll be right back.” Beth scooped up the now-empty cookie plate. Maybe she’d put a few more on it on her way back. *I wonder if the girls have finished theirs,* she thought, and then looked out onto the patio.

The glare of the sun made it difficult to see clearly, but it was immediately obvious that the girls weren’t at their tea party anymore. Beth shielded her eyes, and spied the two girls in their party dresses.

The plate fell to the floor and shattered. Beth was in motion and starting to yell. Her hand fumbled as she tried to rip open the door to the sun room. Her hand didn’t seem to work right as she stared at the events unfolding in slow-motion outside. The girls were in the pool area. The gate was open. They were standing right at the edge of the pool.

She tore her gaze away long enough to look at the doorknob and force her hand to work right and twist the slippery plastic knob. Behind her, she heard but ignored Jazz’s confused yell. The door opened and the cooler air outside seemed to clarify things.

The girls were holding hands. And then they jumped out onto the pool cover.

“No!” Beth yelled, but that changed nothing. The girls’ giggles turned into screams and then were cut off as they disappeared into the water. The pool cover collapsed under them and filled with water immediately, wrapping the girls in plastic.

Everything went so slowly as Beth tried to force her legs to run. It felt like one of those dreams where you had to run as fast as you could, but you couldn’t run fast enough. The harder the tried, the slower you went.

Beth banged off the pool’s safety gate, and jumped into the dark hole in the middle of the cover where the girls had disappeared.

Just before she hit the water and went under, Beth thought she heard a high-pitched laugh.

## Chapter Four: Boiling Point

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora felt like she had opened a dark door in her mind and now she couldn’t close it. The idea had gnawed at her all night. When she had gotten any sleep at all, it had been filled with dreams of doctors forcing a tube into her throat while nurses held her arms and legs. No matter how hard she thrashed, she couldn’t stop them as they forced her mouth open and the cold, hard tube invaded her mouth and throat.

And there had been other, dark memories. Memories that she had kept inside for ten years.

*There are no such things as pixies.* It had all been so long ago. It was like a mix of a bad dream and a hallucination, more than a memory.

But somehow, now that the door was open, Aurora couldn’t seem to stop the flashes of sights and sounds from coming back to her. Visions of pearlescent wings, giant trees and birds that could snap her up. Jumping spiders that were the size of large dogs to her.

A blind woman who could do something for her Dad.

*Lunid was dead. Lunid never existed. There are no such things as Pixies.*

The room was only just starting to lighten in the morning when there was a soft knock at her door. Mom pushed the door open further.

“Aurora, are you awake?” she whispered. Aurora just grunted.

“I got the test results back yesterday afternoon. In all that happened… they are negative. You can go back to school today.”

Aurora only grunted. With one eye, she looked at her clock. It was still quarter to six. *I guess Mom didn’t sleep, either.*

“I thought you would want to know.” Aurora heard the door swing to again, and her Mom’s soft footsteps receding on the hall carpet.

It was a relief to go to school. Even if it was the review period before exams, it was better than sitting in her room. Jimmy and Seve didn’t share her feelings. They both yelled, argued and Seve even cried at breakfast, but Mom wouldn’t let them get away with missing school now.

Mind-numbing was exactly what she wanted, and that was what she got. Aurora had mastered all of the material, and finished all of the review exercises too quickly. It was a sign of her desperation that she decided to help some of her classmates with the reviewing. She had never had time for any of them, and they had always held her in a sort of contempt. But school was what she was good at, and even her classmates could recognize that.

After the school bell rang, Aurora knew she had to go home. She didn’t want to go. Nothing waited there except more waiting and dark thoughts. The remembrance of last night’s nightmares made her feet drag as she went to her locker and put her books away.

She considered that maybe she should go to the school counsellor. But what would she say? *Hi, I’m pretty sure that I was abducted by fairies when I was in Grade Two. I have been suppressing the memory for ten years. What should I do?* She could imagine the counsellor reaching for a bottle of pills. The explanation would be obvious: a young girl under tremendous pressure with her father in the hospital. Her imagination has started to compensate for the stresses of life.

The thing was, Aurora wasn’t sure they were wrong.

“There she is,” came a young man’s voice as Aurora stood staring at her locker. She closed her eyes for a moment. *What now?*

She looked, and it was Joshua, one of the boys from her Chemistry class. She had helped him in the review session today. The guy had no sense at all of how organic chemistry worked. On the question asking what the building block of organic chemistry was, he’d written ‘concrete’. He was a few inches taller than her, with thick dark hair that swept up from his forehead. He also had thick eyebrows that shaded blue eyes. He wasn’t bad-looking. But he certainly wasn’t her type. He was accompanied by an asian boy with black hair that was spiked up to abnormal heights, and two girls. Aurora knew them: Narissa and Francesca. She would be surprised if they knew who she was, but they were from that class of girls in high school that seemed to exist only to make life hard for people like Aurora.

They came close. Aurora crossed her arms and leaned back against her locker. She hoped it looked cool. At the least, it protected her back.

“Hey, Aurora,” said Joshua. “We were going down to Lee’s Store. You wanna come with?”

Aurora’s eyes narrowed involuntarily. She was expecting insults or other torment. There didn’t seem to be any in what he said. She didn’t particularly want to go to the store, nor go anywhere with these people. But this was worthy of understanding.

“Me?” she asked.

“Yeah, you. We’re going now. Or do you need to catch the bus?”

“No, I walk to school,” said Aurora. She considered lying that she had too much homework, but right now the review was so light that she didn’t think she could say it with a straight face. She looked from face to face, and didn’t sense any hostility or ridicule. This was unprecedented. Joshua was definitely B-tier cool at the high school. Not A-tier, but at least a couple tiers higher than Aurora. She and the few study partners she had were F-tier.

“Sure, just let me grab my bag.” She turned to unlock her locker, but kept an eye on the four others just in case they were waiting for her to turn away before attacking or something. They didn’t. They didn’t even stare to see what her combination was. That was a definite possibility: they were there to learn her combo and put something in her locker when she wasn’t around.

She stuffed a couple textbooks and notebooks in her bag and slammed the door shut again.

“Great,” said Joshua. They all shouldered their bags and headed for the front exit. Aurora hung back, following the others, but Joshua dropped back to walk beside her. He didn’t say anything. Aurora’s hair fell in front of her face on the left side, and it provided some cover as she stole glances at him.

When they were out in the sunshine, the crowd thinned and there was room to space properly. Joshua pulled his mask down under his chin. Aurora didn’t know that he’d grown a thin little moustache. It was a sad little thing, not even as full as his eyebrows, but she bit her lip and didn’t say anything. She unhooked her own mask from her ears and stuffed it into her vest pocket.

Aurora was wearing he sort of clothes she always wore: a t-shirt and some casual pants. Today the weather was nice enough that she had her fleece vest on. Her wardrobe was sourced at the local Value Village thrift store. Her mom always ragged on her to dress nicer, but she didn’t see the point. It gave her some joy to know that these clothes were having a second life.  The t-shirt was one of her favorites. It had a silk-screened picture of Albert Einstein sticking his tongue out. It summed up her point of view nicely.

Joshua and his friends were dressed the way that her mom would have liked: everything looked new and expensive. Narissa was even wearing low heels. Her own shoes were Adidas runners. They looked like they were from the early 80’s. Maybe they were.

“That was some review session today, huh?” asked Joshua. It was loud enough that it wasn’t addressed just to Aurora. His friends all agreed.

“I am so going to fail,” moaned Francesca.

“Maybe we should all just accept that, and make plans to attend summer school together,” said the asian boy. “Assuming my mom lets me live.”

“My dad will kill me if I fail,” said Narissa. “I’ve already got accepted to Camosun.”

Aurora didn’t know what to say. She was already planning a couple years ahead in University. She wasn’t even really thinking about final exams.

“You won’t have any troubles, will you?” said Joshua to Aurora.

“Oh, I’ve got troubles,” said Aurora. She didn’t mean to say it. She didn’t really want to say anything that these kids might use against her someday.

“I think you know the material better than the teacher,” said Joshua. Aurora felt some heat in her cheeks and she ducked her head. It was true, but she didn’t expect these kids to acknowledge it.

When she didn’t say anything, Joshua kept prying. “Then what troubles?”

Aurora dodged the question. “Are you going to college next year?”

“Yeah, I’m signed up. Computer programming. Web developer stuff.” That made Aurora miss a step. Joshua didn’t miss it. “What?” he said with a big grin.  “You didn’t think I would be signed up?”

“Maybe not for programming,” she admitted. She wrote a fair bit of code herself, mostly to run her simulations. It wasn’t for meatheads.

“What, you figured auto shop?”

“Well… I don’t know,” Aurora said. She didn’t want to aggravate these kids. They were mostly alone on the sidewalk now. Lee’s corner store was just ahead. There was a light crowd there, but if these four started tormenting her, there were no adults or teachers to intervene. “I don’t know anything about any of you. Nothing personal. But what kind of person thinks that organic chemistry is based on concrete. It’s so obviously carbon.”

“I suppose I deserved that. I said that to bug you, you know. You were being so serious.”

They crossed the small parking lot of the store, and went inside, slipping their masks back on. Aurora had no idea why she was here. She didn’t really want anything, but when Joshua headed for the ice slushie machine, she supposed something cool wouldn’t be bad. Her mom wouldn’t like her having that much sugar, but how often did something like this happen? Never.

Aurora grabbed a small cup and chose the pink cream soda flavor. It was the best of the options. When it was full, her eyes goggled when she looked at Joshua’s cup. It was a large cup, and a mix of brown, white, pink and green. He’d taken some of all the flavors.

“That’ll be rancid,” said Aurora, pointing.  He stuffed the oversized straw in. He pulled his mask up and took a long sip.

“Mmm,” he said with a big smile. Then he slapped his hand to his forehead and started moaning. “Brain freeze!” he said, dancing. His friends laughed at him. Aurora smiled despite herself.

When they’d paid and were outside again, standing in a circle and sipping their frozen drinks, Joshua proved that he didn’t know when to let something go.

“What’s your trouble?” he asked. Aurora choked on the sip she had been taking.

She sighed. “My dad,” she said.

“He tough on you?” Francesca asked. “Mine never says anything nice.”

“No, no.” Aurora said. She felt hot pricks of moisture in her eyes. She’d managed to avoid thinking too much today. She couldn’t imagine her father being anything like how these kids described theirs. It made the situation all the worse. “He’s in the hospital.”

“He’s got the ‘rona?” asked Joshua, grinning, but the grin slipped when Aurora nodded. “Oh jeez, I’m sorry. Is he okay? Was he vaxxed?”

“Yeah,” said Aurora. “He’s in the ICU.”

“Wait, your last name is Johnstone, right?” asked Narissa. “Like as in ’Mr. Johnstone, the Bio teacher?”

“Whoa, I heard he was dying,” said the asian boy.

“No!” exclaimed Aurora. It just slipped out. There was a silence. “I mean… he’s going to get better… what the hell is your name, anyways?” she asked.

“Edwin,” said the boy. “I’m sorry. My mom tells me I speak an hour before I think. It was what some of the kids were saying. He teaches the grade tens.”

“Can you visit him?” asked Joshua.

“No,” said Aurora. “I… I saw him on FaceTime just before he… he went on the ventilator.”

“No shit,” breathed Francesca. Her face was pale and her eyes were wide. “You hear about shit like that, but… your dad.”

“I gotta get home,” lied Aurora. Her slushie was still half full. She hated to throw it in the garbage, but she didn’t want to stay and finish it. In fact, the ultra-sweet taste was making her want to vomit at the moment. “It was nice meeting you all. Thanks.”

She tossed her unfinished drink in the garbage bin and walked briskly away. She didn’t look back. There were real tears on her cheeks now.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

It didn’t get any better when she got home.

“Where were you?” asked Mom as soon as Aurora got through the door. The walk had dried her tears, and she’d gained some equilibrium in the time it took to walk from the corner store to home. At first it had been difficult to put Dad out of her mind, but she’d managed. She only wanted to get into her room and seal the world away again.

“With some friends,” said Aurora. She kicked off her shoes and put down her school bag. Mom was in the front room.

“No, really,” asked Mom.

If her father had said that, Aurora would have known it to be a joke: gentle teasing of his awkward girl. But when Mom said it, there was a bite to it. Aurora took a breath, picked up her bag again and walked past the front room, heading for the stairs.

“Aurora, answer my question!” snapped Mom. It was the tone that stopped the girl dead. It was a mother’s tone. She put her bag on the first step, and turned back to the front room.

The room was quiet. The TV wasn’t on. The blinds were half-drawn, making the light dim. Her mom was sitting on the couch, with her back to the light of the window. A *Shape* magazine was on the cushions next to her. Her legs were tucked up as she sat lounged against the armrest.

“I was at Lee’s. Some kids from school asked me.”

“You could have picked up a milk while you were there.”

For some reason, that irritated Aurora to no end. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t know where to begin.

“Is there anything else, Mom?” she asked.

“Are you just going to sulk in your room?”

“Yes.” She tried to put some heat in the word. It worked. Her mom’s eyes flared. Aurora noticed that there was an empty glass and a half-empty bottle of gin on the coffee table. “I’m not old enough to just drink myself stupid.”

There was a moment of shock. Aurora was shocked that she had said it. From the look on her mom’s face, she was shocked to have heard it.

Her mom rose from the couch. The slight sway when she did so took away some of the seriousness, but the avalanche was coming.

“How I choose to face the future is none of your business, young lady,” she said. It wasn’t yelling. It was a low voice, hard. Aurora thought about retorting, but her mom continued.

“I love your father. With all my heart. If he were to… to die, I would die inside.”

“And I wouldn’t?” said Aurora. She crossed her arms.

“Oh, you would, I know it. You two have been inseparable since you left the cradle. But maybe you aren’t thinking clearly, young lady. This,” she waved around the room, “this all exists because your father and I are a team. We work, we pay the bills. If he dies, I don’t know what we will do.” Her voice broke on the last word.

“Don’t be melodramatic,” said Aurora. “You’ve got insurance.”

“Enough to keep the creditors away, but not enough to live here.” Aurora hadn’t considered anything like that. The Johnstones had lived here since before she had been born. “And if you don’t get those scholarships you’ve applied for, you won’t be going to University. We won’t have the money.”

“Go fuck yourself,” spat Aurora. That was the only thing that mattered to her. “Why would you even say that?”

“You need to wake up, girl. You know so much about the world except what it means to live in it. And you might find out really soon that it’s not all books and microscopes.”

“He’s going to live,” said Aurora in barely more than a whisper. “But I know how to live. And I will.”

With that, she turned and ran from the room, grabbing her book bag as she swept up the stairs. Her door slammed behind her, rattling the bobble headed Funko Pop Fellowship of the Ring on her shelf.

Her heart was racing and her breaths came hard.

*Oh shit, did I just tell my mom to go fuck herself?*

That would have consequences. No matter what happened. Right now, Aurora doubted her mom could make it up the stairs to continue the fight, but it couldn’t end like this.

A flash at Aurora’s window made her jump. It was a metallic, iridescent shine as something flew past at high speed. Her first thought was that Lily had come back.

That made her go cold inside. *Am I going to spend the rest of my life thinking about hallucinations?* Cautiously, she moved to her window and looked out.

She was right to doubt: it was only her brothers. They had their racing drones out, and they were running through their obstacle course in the back yard. Both had their remote controls in hands and a VR headset on their faces. It was a beautiful afternoon and they were only seeing it through the stereo vision in their goggles.

The drones whizzed around the yard, always tightly controlled by her brothers. They carved paths through the air, moving from waypoint to waypoint: going through a hoop at the far corner, pulling a fast 360 around the bean poles, climbing up the corner of the house, and then screaming down past Aurora’s window to start the circuit again. Unbidden, the thought came that her brothers really were quite good. They had local racing trophies to show for it, but it was another thing to actually watch them do their thing.

Unfocusing her eyes, Aurora watched the shiny color-and-chrome shapes whirling around the yard. The old oak tree that used to sit in the middle of their yard was long gone. A rot had gnawed at its roots and a windstorm had blown it down years ago. She hadn’t sat on the swing on that tree for years after… the event. But now that she was imagining, the drones reminded her of the whirling cyclone of pixies and faeries that Lunid had swept up and frozen.

Aurora put her arms on the window sill and rested her forehead on them, staring at the floor.

*Why? Why now?* Why was she suddenly obsessing over these old memories? She hadn’t thought about them for ten years. Was this a breakdown?

Turning her head to the left, Aurora looked at the miniature Jabba’s Palace that sat on the windowsill, in the corner. Behind the palace, the glass of the window distorted the view outside, but the bug screen was behind the double-paned glass. Aurora lifted her head, remembering something else.

She moved closer and picked up the miniature. There, concealed, was a hole in the screen, patched over with a mismatched piece of screen. It was a few centimeters across.

The thing was, she suddenly remembered going through that hole, being pulled out and flying through the night air, off into the forest.

There was a hole. She didn’t hallucinate it.

Aurora looked over the back fence to the dark canopy of the forest behind it. What was back there?

## Chapter Five: Urgent

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick sat on the bus seat, rocking with the motion of the bus. It was raining today. He didn’t particularly like the idea of riding to work in the rain, so he took the extra time and caught a couple of buses. He would have to walk a few blocks, but he had an umbrella with him. The weather was grey, through the water and grime splattered bus window. Nick hoped that they would spend today indoors, going through the results so far.

It had been two days of field surveys so far. Nick was sore from spending the whole day scrambling through the underbrush. He’d never considered before just how rocky and hilly Victoria was where it wasn’t paved or gardened. He shifted a little on his seat, trying to find a position where his muscles felt more relaxed.

Something was bugging him about this job. He pulled out his phone and texted to his friend Richard.

*You up?* he wrote. A few seconds later, three wiggling dots in a message bubble showed up.

*I am. Gotta get to work in 15. What’s up?* Right. Nick had forgotten that Richard had a summer job at the Sobey’s grocery store. They hadn’t seen each other in a week.

*Confused. Why are they having me run this field study?* He hit Send. Dots appeared.

*You complaining? Grow a pair, bud.* The angry, swearing emoji followed. Nick sighed. Maybe texting wasn’t the right way to have this conversation.

*You available tonight?*

*Yes.*

*Drinks at the SUB?* The Student Union Building pub was a good place to get reasonably-priced beers. A decent chance to meet up with other interesting people, too.

*OK. 8 o’clock?* Nick answered with a thumbs up and then put his phone away. It was only one block to his stop.

When he entered the office door, Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson were already there and waiting. “Sorry,” said Nick as he checked his watch. “I took the bus today. Took a little longer to get here.”

Neither Mr. Beattie nor Miss Patterson answered immediately. They seemed to be concerned. Mr. Beattie was sitting askew in one of the office chairs, tapping his lips with a single long finger. Miss Patterson was standing with her back to the windows looking out on the rear garden. Her hands were clasped at her waist, and she was looking at Mr. Beattie.

“What is it? Has something happened?” The last time Nick had felt something like this was when he’d walked in on his parents after Uncle Albert died.

Neither answered right away. The young man started to feel a cold spot in his stomach. He wasn’t doing a good enough job. He was going to get fired. *Oh man. Not good.* Rather than continue to prod for more information, he turned to the immediate. Neither of them looked like they were ready to go into the sodden forest, so hung his wet umbrella by the door and took off his raincoat. *Might as well pretend everything is fine.* There was the usual thermal carafe of coffee at the service station, so he helped himself to a cup and added some of the low-calorie sweetener. They still hadn’t said anything.

When the silence was broken, it was not Mr. Beattie: it was Miss Patterson.

“Mr. Beattie, if you want to change our study to be more direct, it is up to you to speak to Mr. Jackson.”

*Uh oh. It’s true, they aren’t happy with the job I’m doing.* Nick took a sip and tried to make his hands steady. *If I lose this job, how am I going to find another for the summer? I might have to ask Richard if there’s a job at Sobey’s.*

Mr. Beattie took a heavy breath. “I know, Miss Patterson. But do I want to? I think that we will be successful doing as we are.”

“Lawrence.” The name hung in the air. It even shocked Nick to hear it. Miss Patterson composed herself. “Mr. Beattie, the body count is rising. I know you want to keep the science pure, but we are talking about *lives* here.”

“I know. I know.” Silence fell again.

It didn’t sound like they were arguing about the job he was doing. At least Nick couldn’t figure any way that their words added up to that. *Body count?* He sat backwards in an available chair, leaning his chest on the backrest. Whatever they were arguing about, he needed to hear this.

“It’s just that…” Mr. Beattie seemed at a loss for words. Nick had never seen that happen. “There is a chance here to make a breakthrough. Something absolutely earth-shattering.”

“But it’s not about that any more,” said Miss Patterson. “What’s more important?”

“And look foolish? We stop this, we intervene, assuming we can, and then what? We would be no better than the crackpots who end up on the tabloid covers!” Nick had never seen Mr. Beattie like this.

“This isn’t about you, and you know it. There are two girls and a mother right now, lying in the morgue.”

“Dammit, I know! I was the one who went and saw them.”

“Then you know what you have to do.” Miss Patterson turned to the window, looking out on the grey weather.

Mr. Beattie shot a glance at Nick. Nick tried to remain impassive. Whatever this argument was, it was serious. *Dead girls? What have I gotten into?*

“I will compromise. It’s the right thing to do. But I will not go all the way. Mr. Jackson right now is an impartial observer. I *won’t* sacrifice that. Agreed?” Miss Patterson, at the window, nodded once.

Nick went to take another sip of his coffee, but his cup was empty. When had he drunk it?

“Mr. Jackson,” Mr. Beattie began, “Mr. Jackson, there is more to our search than only looking for an invasive species.”

“Yes sir.”

“I want to continue our survey, but we need to move more quickly. The methodical search that you have been conducting is exemplary, but we need more haste. As much as I hate to do it‚Äî” he shot a look at Miss Patterson, but she was not looking, “‚ÄîI will reveal a little more. There are a series of criminal activities that are having real consequences all along the fringes of that forest.”

“What kind?” asked Nick.

“That I will leave for now,” said Mr. Beattie. “It’s not strictly important. What is important is that I believe that by completing your survey we would have been able to pinpoint the activity in the forest. I still believe that. But while we move slowly, there are people dying.”

“Now, knowing that, how would you suggest altering your approach?”

Nick sat there, stupefied.

“People are… I’m not a police officer. What am I supposed to do to help?” asked Nick.

“You don’t need to do anything of that nature. What I want is to gather the clues, build a picture and then bring it to the authorities. I just know that it needs to be bulletproof. If we go there with a story that sounds fantastic we won’t solve anything. Now, if we were going to find that invasive species but do it a lot faster, how would we go about it?”

“Can… can I have a few minutes? To think?” asked Nick.

“Please do. Your first plan was very good. I would like you to come up with another that’s equally as good.” Mr. Beattie rose from his office chair and straightened his trousers, then his waistcoat. “I will be in the library, Miss Patterson. Let’s regroup at ten-thirty and review the progress.”

Nick gulped but nodded. That was less than two hours away. Mr. Beattie left the office room. The door swung shut and closed with a soft click. Nick jumped up and pulled his chair over to the big work table. He grabbed a pencil from the cup and grabbed a few sheets of paper. It was time to brainstorm.

Miss Patterson pulled a chair up to the table and sat down in that elegant, straight-backed way she had.

“Are you going to help?” asked Nick.

“If I can,” she said with an almost imperceptible nod. “If you need me to build a shopping list or find anything that meets your needs online, I would be happy to.” There was an intensity to how she said it that grabbed Nick’s attention.

Nick shot a glance at the door, but it was still closed. He leaned closer to Miss Patterson. “Can you tell me anything more about what he needs to find here?” Nick waved a hand at the empty sheets of paper on the table. “I could use all the hints I can get.”

Miss Patterson looked torn. “Maybe I should leave,” she said, but she did not rise from her chair.

“No, stay,” said Nick. “I could use the help, like you suggested. I just…” he ran a hand over his hair. It was tied back at his neck as usual. “If I’m looking for something small, like a fly, then I don’t know how we’re going to speed up. Look for swarms or nests or something. But if it’s larger, like‚Äî”

“Like a mantis,” interrupted Miss Patterson.

“A mantis,” repeated Nick.

“It’s not a mantis,” she said, blushing.

“Yeah, I figured. Not many mantis species that can cause human deaths.” As soon as he said it, Nick stopped to consider. *Was there a connection? Something that was causing deaths in the forest?* Mr. Beattie has mentioned these events happening along the fringes of the forest. What if… “There isn’t something in the forest that we should be protecting ourselves from, right? Wearing protective gear or something like that?”

“I’ve been out there with you, haven’t I” she asked, quirking an eyebrow.

“Yeah, you’re right. Okay. Mantis-sized. *Not* a mantis, I know,” he said when he saw her begin to correct him.

In two hours, Nick had a bunch of scribbles on sheafs of paper and Miss Patterson had started to gather a series of links for online purchases. They were ready to buy if Mr. Beattie approved. Nick moved to the Smart board and had the pen in hand when Mr. Beattie walked in. The clock in the front hall chimed the half hour exactly as the door opened.

“You look prepared,” said Mr. Beattie, eyeing the board marker in Nick’s right hand and the rumpled papers in the left.

“So to speak,” said Nick. “I’ve got some thoughts. I think we could successfully monitor the forest with a day’s work.”

“Intriguing,” he said. He settled himself on the edge of the work table, facing the board. “Proceed.”

“We‚Äî”, Nick indicated Miss Patterson, “‚Äîthought that a two-pronged approach was the right one. Since we don’t know what it is we are looking for…” *That should give Miss Patterson some cover in case he thinks she cheated.* “…that we could divide into looking for large and small. Larger insects tend to be solitary, but there are motion detectors on the market that could detect the movement of something as small as this.” Nick held up his pinky finger. “We could set up a network like this.”

The irregular polygon shape of the forest area was already outlined in green on the board. Nick drew small blue circles in a grid pattern in the middle of the shape. There were large gaps between the circles.

“These represent the rough sensing radius of a detector that Miss Patterson has found. The range would probably be less and trees would get in the way, but the circles give a rough idea.” Mr. Beattie was nodding. “They have a 36-hour replaceable battery and will take an infrared photo when triggered. It’s stored on internal storage, so we would have to visit every sensor every day to replace the battery and download any data. That leads into the second prong of the plan.”

“Go on,” said Mr. Beattie. A trace of a smile was threatening to bend his mouth.

“We’ll have to figure out a good route to visit all of the sensors each day, but if we vary it each day, we will put a lot of kilometers of walking in, through all of the intervening space.” Nick switched to red and started drawing a zig zagging route that connected the centers of all the circles.

“This route would give us the opportunity to search for the small. I’m thinking about looking for nests, hives or swarms of smaller species. Our coverage of the forest wouldn’t be as methodical as we have been going, but we would probably cover eighty percent over the course of a week.”

“There is one problem, though,” said Nick. Miss Patterson shook her head and gave a tight smile.

“What is that?” asked Mr. Beattie.

“It’s the cost of the sensors. And the batteries. We’re going to need about two dozen, minimum. It’s… it’s…” he swallowed. “It’s going to cost about twenty-four thousand.” Nick winced. As a student at university, he’d never even seen twenty-four thousand dollars. It was enough for tuition and books for three years. It was three times what he was going to net this summer working for Mr. Beattie. And he was proposing to throw it at finding some bugs. When he heard the works coming out of his own mouth, he thought he was crazy.

“Let me see if I understand. Excellent presentation, by the way.” Nick felt a flush at the compliment. “With these sensors, I will have daily updates on the movement of anything larger than a finger moving through large portions of the forest?”

“Well, yes. It might be a lot of noise in the signal but that’s the idea.”

“And it would cost approximately twenty-five thousand?”

“Twenty-four, yes.”

“Things always are more expensive than you expect, Mr. Jackson. Better to round up. Add the personnel costs of yourself and Miss Patterson’s time, et cetera. And every day we could have a new, different spiderweb of a hiking route through the forest, filling in the spaces?” Nick nodded.

“Fantastic. I would never have guessed it was possible. I wonder what it would cost to have a cellular-connected set of sensors? That would be cool, don’t you think?”

“You want to do it?” asked Nick, dumbfounded.

“There is an optional cellular module for the sensors, Mr. Beattie,” said Miss Patterson. It would double the cost. We could pilot the system as proposed and consider the live connection later.”

“Yes, good thinking. I like it. Who is the vendor?” Miss Patterson moved to her computer station, and Mr. Beattie followed, looking over her shoulder. “Five days for delivery. That is far too slow. Contact them directly. Get them to overnight it. Better yet, same-day.” He turned to Nick.

“See, that’s why you round up, Mr. Jackson. I imagine the extra shipping will be a thousand. Care to bet on it?”

Nick was still dumbfounded. “What if it doesn’t work?” he said, his voice thin. His throat was dry. This man was spending twenty-five thousand on a harebrained scheme that he had cooked up in an hour and a half.

“I imagine there are people who would be happy to take them off our hands for research, Mr. Jackson. But I have a good feeling about this. Miss Patterson, let them know that we want to reserve an equal number of the cellular units if this pays off.”

Miss Patterson was already on the phone, and listening to whatever was on the line. She nodded and made a note on her notepad.

“In the meantime, we need to find someone to crunch the data for us,” said Mr. Beattie. “We’re going to get a boatload of infrared images if what you say is correct.” Nick nodded agreement. They had seen many squirrels and birds as well as smaller ground-dwelling rodents that they hadn’t bothered to classify. Rabbits. There would be hikers and dogs. Maybe even cats hunting. They would be drowned by low-resolution images of basically everything the size of a dragonfly and larger.

“You haven’t programming skills, have you? They weren’t on your resume.”

“No, sorry.”

“Well, while Miss Patterson is getting our devices ASAP, could you reach out to your co-op supervisors and start the process of finding someone who will be able to help us out? Would you mind unduly if I look at your sensor placement and refine it?”

Nick had barely stuttered an affirmative when Mr. Beattie was pulling up the aerial photo of the forest and starting to move the blue circles on the diagram that Nick had drawn. He turned and moved to his own desk and found the number of his supervisor and dialed his phone.

“Hello, this is Mark Sutcliffe,” came the voice on the line.

“Hi, Dr. Sutcliffe, this is Nick Jackson. I’m in the department’s co-op program. I’m working at Beattie Analytics.”

“Jackson, Jackson… oh yes. I remember you. Third year. Ponytail, am I right?”

“Yes, sir.” Nick smiled. These white people. Always looking for ways to describe him other than black.

“What can I do for you, Nick? I have another call in seven minutes.”

“This shouldn’t take too long. Mr. Beattie…” for a second, Nick realized he had made the call without organizing his thoughts. He paused and started again. “Our research here is going to create a small mountain of data. We need someone with the skills to sift through it fast.”

“Data analytics?”

“Programming, Mr. Beattie said. Do you know who I should talk to?”

“Is this another potential co-op position? We’re always looking to place more students. Although programming skills aren’t that common.”

“I don’t know, maybe. It sounds more like helping us through a jam. Maybe a week or two? Is there anyone who can help?” Nick looked to where Mr. Beattie was still drawing on the board. There were now stars along the edge of the forest. Nick was confused for a moment, but then he recognized some of them as the arson locations.

“I’m going through the resumes on file here Nick,” said Dr. Sutcliffe. “This time of the semester, most of the candidates are already placed.” There was another pause. Nick could hear the clicking of a mouse over the line. “No, none of the available co-op students in Biology have programming skills. Wait,” he said. “She’s not in the program, but she’s applied for next year.” There was another pause.

“Can I email your boss Mr. Beattie a resume? She’s in high school, but she’s been doing some work with the research interns on and off for the last couple of years. She might jump at this.”

“A high schooler?” *A girl?* When Nick pictured a coder, he thought of a young male with no social skills.

“I can send the resume. I’ve got the address here. Aurora Johnstone.”

“Thanks, I’ll let Mr. Beattie know to expect it.”

“No problem, Nick. Everything else going okay there?” Nick that to think about that for a second.

“It’s going great, Dr. Sutcliffe. Couldn’t ask for better.” Just because he didn’t understand what was going on or how his work might stop people from dying didn’t mean it wasn’t going well.

The call ended. Mr. Beattie was still at the board, but it looked like he was satisfied with the plan. Miss Patterson put the phone received into the cradle.

“They will be here by five PM,” she said.

“Fantastic!” said Mr. Beattie. He put the digital pen down on the table. “Let’s hope that the weather lets up or we will be damp tomorrow putting this together. Nick, are you okay staying late tonight? I’d like to unbox them and figure out how they work before tomorrow.”

Nick thought about meeting up with Richard at eight. “Yeah, sure, it’s okay.” *If it’s too late, I’ll just call Richard and let him know I’ll be late.*

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora and her mom weren’t talking. That was fine with Aurora. She didn’t want to fight with her again, and if silence was the alternative, then she was fine with it. They hadn’t said a word at breakfast, and maybe for the first time ever, Aurora left the house to go to school without anyone wishing her to have a good day.

That occurred to her as she stood on the front doorstep, opening her umbrella to ward off the grey, drizzling rain. She shrugged it off, and started for school.

Along the way, the same thoughts from the previous night dogged her steps. *Not going to university.* That was so unthinkable she could hardly bring herself to imagine it. She had been laser-focused on it since she could remember. Dad had always acted like it was a foregone conclusion. Her grades had always been the top in the class, and she had even started building relationships at the University, helping out as a volunteer for the unpaid interns. Going there was her next step, no matter what happened.

What Mom had said, about money and what would happen if Dad died disturbed her. She had never really focused on money and had never had a job. She’d babysat for her Mom a few times and a few times for the neighbours. That girl Abbie down the street was a sweetheart. She liked babysitting her. Maybe it was time that she start to try to save some money for herself.

School was as dreary as the day. She was surprised that Joshua and his friends still acknowledged her in the hall, but they didn’t have class together today. More review, more mind-numbing time-filling.

It was five minutes to three when Aurora felt her phone buzz in her pocket. She looked around. Normally, it was against the rules to check texts in class, but the teacher was looking as ready as the students to leave. Aurora never got texts, except from Mom or Dad. Daring the teacher to say anything, she slipped the phone out and looked at the lock screen.

It was a message from Mom. She couldn’t tell what it said until she unlocked it. When the phone had accepted her fingerprint, the message expanded to show what Mom had sent.

*Come straight home.*

There was nothing else, only that. None of the normal heart emojis to end the text. No preamble or explanation. Aurora felt cold. She was going to catch it for what she had said the afternoon before. Her mother had thought long enough on it, and now the punishment was coming.

Straightening, Aurora put her phone away and sat at her desk, waiting for the last three minutes of the school day to count down. Whatever awaited at home, she would face it head-on. Nothing would change her plans. She just needed to come up with alternative ways to achieve them. She could see that now.

She didn’t need her umbrella walking home. Everything was still damp from the rain, but the sky was filled with broken clouds with blue peeking through. The gentle wind was coming from the west and it promised a change in the weather back to warmer late-spring conditions. Aurora marched up her front walk and unlocked the door with her key. She made no attempt to sneak in or dash up the stairs.

“I’m home!” she yelled, like she used to when she was a kid.

“We’re in here,” came her mom’s voice from the front room. It was husky, like she’d been crying.

Aurora took off her coat before looking around the corner. There, in the center of the couch was Mom. Under each arm was one of her sons: Jimmy was snuggled against her on the left, and Seve was on the right. For a moment, Aurora thought it was strange that her brothers were hugging Mom and not trying to get away, but then she caught the hitches in their breath and saw their reddened eyes and understood.

“Dad?” she asked.

“He’s still alive,” said Mom. “But the hospital called. It could be any time now.”

“Can’t we… Shouldn’t we… be at the hospital?” Aurora asked, but her Mom shook her head.

“I’ll be going soon. He’s still on the ventilator. We can’t all go, but I couldn’t go until you came home. I didn’t want… I wanted to be the one to tell you.” Mom’s voice cracked, and sobs caused her to shake.

“I can’t go?”

“No, honey. The hospitals are so full right now, and they only want one visitor. Dad won’t be able to speak. Don’t worry, I will tell him that we are all thinking about him and love him so much.” She barely managed to finish the sentence.

Jimmy spoke, sniffing. “We’re supposed to stay here. Mom will let us know.” He didn’t say what Mom would let them know, but it was implied that it was a matter of when, not if.

Mom gave her boys one more squeeze then got up. For a moment, there was awkwardness. Aurora knew that she’d behaved badly, and they hadn’t gotten past that yet. But in the end, it didn’t matter. She couldn’t say if it was she who hugged her mom or her mom who hugged her, but they did. It didn’t last long enough, before Mom pulled away and got ready to leave.

Aurora felt dazed to be standing on the front porch again, this time standing next to her brothers, waving farewell to her mother as she pulled the car out of the driveway and then drove down the street. It had all happened so quickly. She hadn’t even processed it.

“Did she say what was wrong?” she asked her brothers as they stood, watching the taillights disappearing.

“Just that Dad got a lot worse,” said Seve.

“Why?” Aurora asked, even though there was no answer to that.

“Because doctors suck,” said Jimmy. There was bitterness in his tone. He dashed tears from his eyes.

“They don’t,” Aurora said absently, not really thinking about it. “It’s just the virus‚Äî”

“Doctors suck and medicine sucks and science sucks!” yelled Jimmy suddenly. “The whole world sucks!”

“Jimmy, come on…” Aurora began, but Jimmy wasn’t ready to listen.

“What sort of a world takes a Dad away from his family?” He was still yelling. “I want answers! I want to kick the shit out of the doctors who made that vaccine! It didn’t help one bit!”

“Jimmy, that’s enough!” said Aurora, some heat in her voice.

“Shut up! I don’t want to hear it!” said Jimmy. Seve was looking lost, looking from his older brother to his older sister.

“The vaccine works. Ninety-five percent of the time. That means one in twenty times it won’t. Dad was unlucky. If you’re going to be angry, be angry at the system that exposed him to the virus at school.” Now Aurora was starting to feel angry, too. It fed off of Jimmy’s.

Jimmy stormed into the house, and Seve followed him in, leaving Aurora standing outside. The anger, now that it was lit, was burning inside of her. Days of pent-up emotion seemed to pour gasoline on it, making her burn.

*Jimmy is right. What kind of world takes a father away like this?* No matter that she knew that the universe didn’t care for her feelings one way or the other, it seemed unjust. What was the point of any of it, when everything could come crashing down? A family torn apart by a virus, only microns across?

Aurora went inside, and grabbed her coat from the rack.

“I’m going out!” she yelled. There was no answer.

Aurora stormed out the door. She remembered to close and lock it, but then continued storming down the walk and then down the street. She went past the site of the Eisen house. It was still a ruin. No one had come to knock down the remains of the burnt-out house yet. Police tape still sealed off the yard.

*More chaos. More evidence of a universe that doesn’t care,* she thought as she stomped by.

She didn’t know where she was going, but anywhere had to be better than where she was. There was nothing that she could do right now to make the slightest difference in the world. Her father was dying, and she couldn’t help that. Her life as she knew it was coming to an end, and she could do nothing about that. She would never get to see her first, best friend ever again and she could do nothing about that.

Aurora reached the end of the street. She could either turn and follow the cross-street towards the busier roads in the direction of school and the stores, or she could…

Aurora stood and looked the other way. Here, there was a pathway. A sign of carved and painted wood let everyone know that this was the entrance to the paths in the woods behind her home. A dispenser provided little bags so dog owners could clean up after their pets, and there was an animal-proof garbage receptacle.

But beyond that were the dark shapes of oak and douglas fir trees. Scotch brome bushes added a flash of yellow, but under the canopy there was only shadow.

She hadn’t been in the forest since… or had she? Had it all just been a hallucination? Were the memories that she had real, or were they the half-remembered daydreams of a little girl? If the memories were to be believed, then maybe there *was* something that she could do.

*If medicine has exhausted all avenues, what harm is there in trying a little magic?* The sheer stupidity of the thought shocked and offended her. But in a universe where nothing she did had any meaning, what was the harm in seeing if the memories had any validity?

If they were real, then there was something completely outside the world of science and medicine just waiting there, somewhere in the shadows. If she could find it, then maybe she could tip the scales of the universe in her favor.

If they weren’t real, then where was the harm in going for a walk in the woods? It was just as good a place for her to be as any. A pang of guilt that she should be watching her brothers bugged her for a moment, but she brushed it aside.

Aurora walked through the gate and in a moment was in the shadows under the trees.

## Chapter Six: Dangerous Times

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora wasn’t sure which way to go at first, but then she decided to walk along the property line of the houses on her street. The back fences of the properties made an easy, winding line to follow. Soon she discovered that it wasn’t the easiest way: the open canopy along the private yards encouraged the growth of bushes, especially the Scotch Brome. By moving a little farther under the trees to where she could just make out the fences, the ground was much more open and she made much better progress. It was drier under the trees, too. She pulled out her phone and brought up the map. The little blue dot that represented her location slowly moved northeast as she walked.

When she saw her own back fence and her house rising above it, she stopped and put her hands on her hips and surveyed what she could see. Nothing was familiar to her. She hadn’t expected it to: her memories (or hallucinations) had been from the point of view of being the size of a pixie, and it had been dark as well. It seemed to her that going directly into the forest was the logical thing to do.

The ground was rough, with a thin layer of regolith over barely-concealed bedrock. It was typical Victoria terrain. The places with the best soil had trees rooted deeply in it. The rocky areas only had a mix of grasses and mosses and stunted bushes that lived in the shadow of the trees. No route was purely flat. Aurora was climbing just as much as she was walking.

She had vague recollections of a few landmarks. There were the three grand trees that were the home of the faeries. She didn’t really want to stumble on that, but she supposed that at her full size, there was little risk. There was the home that Lunid had kept, at the base of a tree. It was with a pang of sadness that she remembered that the old woman was dead. If her home still existed, it might be a ruin now. She had never seen the pixies’ home, but she gathered that it was near to Lunid’s home. There was Rainbow Ravine. At first, she thought that that might be the easiest thing to find. But as she scrambled up and down, she began to rethink that. Just about any of these rocks had what felt like ravines between them.

Aurora kept going, keeping one eye on her phone. It wouldn’t be good to get lost. The sun wouldn’t go down for four or five hours, but she intended to be back home long before then.

The courier had arrived early: twenty-four boxes with automatic motion detectors and infrared cameras were lined up on the work table in the office at Mr. Beattie’s house. Two were open, and Miss Patterson and Nick were unpacking a pair of them to see how they worked. The units were surprisingly small, and the instruction manuals appeared to have been run through Google Translate a few times.

“I’ve got a green light!” Miss Patterson said with some excitement.

“What was the trick?” asked Nick. The status light on his was staying resolutely black. She came around the table, and guided Nick to turn the unit over. She pointed to a small transparent tab that was sticking out of a seam on the underside.

“Pull that.”

When Nick did, the status light turned green. It was ready to go. “How did you know to do that?” Nick asked. He turned the instructions over, looking for any hint to do what he had just done.

“I have two nieces. Almost every toy I’ve gotten them for birthdays or Christmas has had something like that. It stops the battery from discharging until you’re ready to use it.”

“Nice. Now what?”

They inserted the SD cards in the units, and the status light blinked twice. Nick turned the dial marked ‘Sensitivity’ to the mid-point, and put put his unit on his desk. Miss Patterson did the same at the far end of the office and they started walking by the units.

“How do we know if they are working?” he asked.

It turned out they were. In two minutes, they popped out the cards and plugged them into Nick’s computer. There were fifty images in total. Nick copied them to the hard drive and then cleared the cards.

“Cool,” he said as he opened the first one.

“It’s a one-eighty degree picture,” said Miss Patterson.

“Is that you?” asked Nick, pointing to the larger of the ghostly shapes in the image. She was right, it was a bit disorienting, but the lens was a fisheye on the device, and it captured a full hemisphere image. That made for a strange photo, but the shapes of two people could easily be seen.

It was in infrared and grayscale, so both he and Miss Patterson’s figures were ghostly in the images. The warmer parts of them, like their eyes and throats, were bright, and their noses were colder. Their clothes were also much darker.

“That’s a lot of images,” said Nick.

“And we’re going to be turning up the sensitivity to the maximum,” said Miss Patterson, nodding.

“Any response from the coder? What was her name?” Nick asked.

“Aurora Johnstone. And no, not yet. I left two messages. One with someone who I think was her mother, and then the next one on an answering service.”

“Well, come this time tomorrow, we might have a thousand weird images to sift through. I don’t look forward to that.”

They set about unboxing the rest of the units. They had twenty-four of them and twenty-four spare batteries and chargers.

“There’s still daylight, do we want to start placing the units?” Nick asked. The weather had improved all day. Now it looked like it was going to be a nice evening.

Miss Patterson put down the last unit and was about to answer, when there was a crash that shook the house. There was the sound of a distant scream.

“What was that?” exclaimed Nick as they both jumped to their feet.

“It was out front!” said Miss Patterson. She hurried to the office door with Nick following. Once on the rich red-and-gold carpet and under the light of the main hall’s chandelier, they found Mr. Beattie rushing down the curved staircase.

“Something has happened on the street,” he said, pulling on an overcoat and perching a hat on his head. He led them out the front door and down the steps to the drive. Nick could see that there was a white car at an odd angle, up against the low brick wall that marked the front of Mr. Beattie’s property. There was steam coming up from it, and there was the sound of voices. People were starting to congregate.

Once out the gate, Nick could see more clearly. A boy’s figure was lying sprawled in the street. He was wearing a pair of blue shorts and a purple shirt. One shoe was lying on the pavement near him. He was lying face down and not moving. The car, a late-model Toyota, was up on the curb and crossing the sidewalk. Its front bumper was crumpled against the brick wall and the steam was coming from under the hood. The driver’s door was open and no one was in the car. A woman, who might have been the driver, was being restrained. She was sobbing as a man was holding her back from the body in the street.

“Has someone called 9-1-1?” asked Mr. Beattie immediately.

“I did,” said a woman who was looking on. She still had her phone to her ear. She waggled the phone at Mr. Beattie. “Yes, one person down, it doesn’t look good…” she said into the phone.

Miss Patterson rushed to where the boy was lying. Nick went to follow, but Mr. Beattie put a hand on his arm and he stopped. “Ellie knows first aid. If anyone can help until the professionals arrive, it’s her.” Nick was relieved. He didn’t have any emergency training. He didn’t know what he would have done. *Probably make things worse.*

“I didn’t see him!” sobbed the woman who was being restrained. She was middle-aged and thin, with streaks of gray in her brown bob. A large pair of gold rings were on her left ring finger, and her clothes looked expensive. “One second everything got dark. I don’t know what happened!”

Mr. Beattie approached the woman, and the man who was restraining her. Whether it was his calm demeanor or his odd dress, as soon as he was there, the woman calmed and stopped to stare.

“Please tell me what you saw,” said Mr. Beattie.

“I‚ÄîI was driving. Not fast. I live just there.” The woman pointed three doors down, on the left. “I was almost home. I‚Äîit just suddenly went dark. Then I felt the thump. Oh, I can’t believe I hit Gary!” She broke down and sobs racked her. She hugged herself, folding in on herself.

“Gary?” Mr. Beattie asked the man.

“The boy,” he said. “Lives next door to Roseanne.” He indicated the sobbing woman.

“You are?” asked Mr. Beattie.

“You police?” asked the man, but when he looked at how Mr. Beattie was dressed, he looked embarrassed to have asked the question. “Jason Richards. I live there.” He pointed to the house three doors down in the other direction. “I was mowing the lawn when it happened. Ran here.” Jason Richards was dressed in work clothes, including a John Deere baseball cap that had seen better days. “I waved to her as she passed my place. She waved back.”

“I can’t say I saw Gary run into the street. I think he was crossing, but I’m not sure. There was just that awful second when I saw he was going to get hit. No brake lights.”

“She wasn’t distracted? A phone? Texting?” asked Mr. Beattie.

“Nah. Hands at ten and two, except for when she waved.”

The sound of an fire engine’s siren was approaching. Miss Patterson rose from where the boy was lying and walked to where Mr. Beattie and Nick were waiting. She indicated for them to follow her, away from the distraught woman.

She shook her head. “No pulse. You can’t see it from here, but there’s a lot of blood. Head injury.”

Just then, there was an explosion. It made all of them jump.

“Jesus! That’s my house!” yelled Jason Richards. He left the woman driver and started running.

His house was engulfed in flames. A large cloud of black smoke was climbing up into the sky. Nick had his phone out and was calling 9-1-1. That other woman might still be on with emergency services, but he didn’t care. The more calls the better. *Wasn’t that what they said?*

In a voice that was low enough that Nick probably wasn’t supposed to overhear, Mr. Beattie spoke to Miss Patterson.

“This is escalating.”

Aurora was standing in a small clearing in the forest, looking up at the trees. There were three old oaks, standing in a triangle that defined the clearing. This was the first part of the forest that had seemed familiar to Aurora. She squinted as she looked up. They might have been the three trees of the faeries’ home, but she wasn’t sure. There certainly wasn’t any other evidence of anything supernatural that she could see.

She looked around. There had been a hill, and a cave that the pixies had been held in, with her brother Jimmy being the jailor. There was no sign of anything like a cave.

Aurora sighed. On one hand, it wasn’t like she really believed any of the things she remembered. On the other, it was still disappointing. It was feeling more and more like her ‘memories’ were only the figments of a young girl’s imagination.

But that was the problem. She knew herself. She remembered what she had been like as a child. She didn’t really *have* an imagination. She was creative: she could imagine solutions to problems. She could create elegant code, if nothing else. But the abstract, the pure creation for its own sake seemed to be something she had never been able to do.

That was why this was so frustrating to Aurora. If she had imagined everything, then why was this the only thing she had ever created? If not, then why was there no evidence? Aurora squatted down, trying to get the perspective of someone shorter, to see if the trees were a match for what she could recall.

It was then that she heard a low boom. It was distant, but powerful enough that she felt it through the soles of her runners. She moved into the middle of the clearing, trying to see if there was any sign of the cause. After a minute, there was a black plume of smoke just over the treetops. She had her phone out and in her hand in a moment, comparing the direction to…

*Home,* she thought. It was hard to tell exactly, but it was in the direction of her home. *Seve and Jimmy.*  She’d left them alone. Aurora started running as fast as she could through the rough terrain. She caught glimpses from time to time of smoke and that made her run faster.

Constable Jeffries itched for a cigarette. She’d quit in the nineties and hadn’t given them another thought once she’d kicked the habit. But now, with the pressure building and still no clues for her to follow, she felt that familiar itch.

The road was a zoo, with emergency personnel of all sorts dealing with the situation. Fire had been the first on the site, responding to the pedestrian collision. Ambulances had followed within minutes, but they had nothing to do. The boy had been declared dead at the scene and had been taken away some time ago. A chalk outline was all that remained of Gary Andersen. The white Prius was still up on the sidewalk, where it had come to a violent rest. Now the Traffic Safety team was there, working, measuring the skid marks and the location of the boy’s outline.

But that was the smaller of the two commotions. More fire units had arrived when the Richards house had gone up in flames. A gas line explosion, apparently. The wife and three kids had been in at the time. If the fire first responders hadn’t already been a block away from the Andersen kid, the rest of the Richards family probably wouldn’t still be alive. The father had been burned, trying to get inside to save his family, but he was at the hospital now. The mother and all three kids were being treated for the smoke. Smoke still rose from the house, where flareups were still being found and doused.

All in all, it was horrible, but it could have been worse. Gary Andersen wouldn’t see it that way, nor did his parents, but it could have been worse.

She wished for a cigarette. *Craven A. That used to be my brand.*

The fire investigation team wouldn’t we able to get in and start working for a while. She’d already spotted Roy and his team assembling. They’d shared a look. You didn’t need to be a genius to spot this pattern. That was five fires, all adjacent to this natural area. Then there were the other incidents. The two girls and the mom drowning: that was the worst.

*Right now, I wouldn’t live in a house backing onto this forest if someone gave it to me,* she thought.

There wasn’t an official investigation into the fire yet, but it was only a matter of time. Constable Jeffries was still assigned to the other arsons and this fire would soon be on the list. As soon as she had heard the call on the police radio, she had driven here. There was a map on the wall back at the station with the locations of all the open cases.

The local news stations were in a frenzy. The Global TV crew was here, set up a block away, outside the traffic control barriers. She wasn’t the only one who had identified the spatial connection to all the fires. She was going to stay away from the TV lights. The last thing she wanted to do was make a statement.

Because she had no idea what was going on.

The department had poured more resources into the investigation as it grew with every event. The public pressure to find the perpetrator was growing to a degree that Jeffries had never seen in her time on the force. Normally, the problem with a case was tying the evidence to a person of interest and building the case. The problem with this was that they had no physical evidence at all.

Every crime had plenty of physical evidence that the fire, drowning, or other event had happened. The problem was there was no evidence pointing to a person having done anything. The fires were all started in places that they should not have. But there was no evidence of a perpetrator. No footprints, no accelerants, no traces near the scene.

Corporal Jeffries looked around. At the last fire, she’d gone door-to-door, checking with the homeowners for doorbell camera footage. Even the neighbor right across the street, whose camera showed the Eisel house, registered nothing. No recorded events during the time when the fire was started. The first recording in the system was when the fire itself triggered the camera. Then when fire units arrived, there had been a flood of thirty second video clips.

*No person leaving by the front, and no evidence of anyone leaving by the rear. What did that leave?*  Flying was the only answer she could come up with.

A familiar figure caught Jeffries’ eye. It was the tall, angular figure of Mr. Lawrence L. Beattie. Today he was in a dapper set of charcoal pants and a deep blue vest, with a camel-colored overcoat over top. The hat was less extravagant as the last one: a simple bowler instead of a top hat this time.

The police officer moved closer. Mr. Beattie wasn’t alone: he was accompanied by two people. There was a woman, probably in her early thirties. She was not dressed in the same fanciful Victorian fashion as Beattie, but her long skirt and button-down blouse spoke had a formal line to them, and she held herself in a way that would impress one of those finishing schools for girls. Next to them was a young black man, with much more casual jeans and a knit sweater on. His long, tightly curled hair was tied back in a ponytail.

“Constable Jeffries,” said Beattie as she approached. She was surprised. Not many people remembered her name. Beattie’s companions hadn’t seen Jeffries approach and were surprised. The woman merely shifted her position to face the police officer. The young man looked nervous.

“Mr. Beattie. We keep meeting like this.”

“I will remind you, that it is I who live here, Constable. My front wall has had a most distressing incident, but it is the absolute least of the tragedies to have occurred today.”

Constable Jeffries eyed the damage. It didn’t look too bad, but it would require a mason of some sort. Her gaze shifted to the yard and the home behind the wall. Her eyebrows rose when she saw them. It looked like something that should have been in the heart of the Uplands. It was exactly the type of house that a man like Beattie should live in. His taste in clothing extended to his garden and home.

“I was told that you called the fire in,” said Jeffries.

“No, that was Mr. Jackson, here,” he said, indicating the young man. “We were here, surveying the collision when the fire started.”

They stood in silence for a moment, everyone looking at the fire.

“You seemed interested in the case, Mr. Beattie.”

“I was,” he said simply.

“Any thoughts you’d like to share? After all, it is your neighborhood.”

“Nothing at present. Only the devout wish that these series of events come to an end immediately.” He gave a weak grin. “I don’t believe I can handle any more tragedy.”

“If you have any information that you would like to share, you still have my number, right?” she asked.

“I do. Good luck, Constable.” He held out his hand. She shook it.

“Thank you.” She shifted to the woman. “Ms…?”

“Patterson.” The woman extended a hand almost daintily.

“And Mr. Jackson. Until we meet again.” She moved away and started circulating through the emergency personnel on scene. The number of police officers was growing. They were going to wait until the fire investigation team did their job, but they were getting ready. Jeffries would have to get everyone organized.

She said a little prayer that they would find something this time. She still wished for that cigarette.

Aurora was breathing easier, now that she saw that the burning house was not her own. Her navigation skills in the forest had been off: she had ended up at the far end of the road and had to run two blocks before it was clear that the Johnstone residence was fine. She had found her brothers in the front yard, both staring at the commotion further up the street.

She had stopped to see if they were all right. The boys had surprised her by giving her a hug.

“I’m going to go and look,” she had said.

“I want to, too,” Seve had said.

“Okay, lock the door and let’s go.”

They had passed the burnt-out ruin of the Eisel house and now they were all standing at the traffic control barriers and looking on at the scene.

“That’s the Richards place,” said Seve. Seve often played with the youngest of the Richards kids, a boy named Aaron. “I hope they’re okay.”

“Oh cool, a chalk outline!” Jimmy said. He didn’t say it loud, but the uniformed police officer standing at the barrier gave him an irritated look.

“Isn’t that Mrs. Ronson’s Prius?” asked Aurora, pointing at the white car resting against the brick wall. Aurora was trying to makes sense of what she was seeing. The fire was self-explanatory, but what was all the rest of it?

Standing there, with her young brothers on either side of her, Aurora started to get that feeling again. It was the feeling that there was a harsh, uncaring universe that would destroy the things she loved. She looked at the fire, still being fought by the firemen, the car, the chalk outline, then back at the Eisel place, and then further along, there was more police tape that she had noticed when running. That was the house where she babysat Abbie.

*What is going on?* she asked herself.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out. It was a number that she had seen calling earlier, but hadn’t answered. She didn’t know anyone named ‘Patterson’. She decided to answer it anyways.

“Hello?”

“Oh, hello. Is this Miss Johnstone?” came a woman’s voice on the line.

“I’m Aurora, yes,” she replied. She and her brothers had to move off the road: the police officer was moving the traffic barriers to let in a 4x4 truck marked with the fire department’s logo.

“I got your name from Dr. Sutcliffe, the Co-op Program Supervisor at the University of Victoria. I understand you know each other?”

“Yes‚Äîyes I know Dr. Sutcliffe,” said Aurora. She had her hand over her other ear so that she could hear the phone better as the truck passed. “Sorry, who is this?”

“My name is Ellie Patterson. I work for a small analytics firm in Victoria and we have some immediate work that Dr. Sutcliffe suggested you for.” Just then, the siren of the passing truck gave one short chirp. It was very loud to Aurora, but the weird thing was that a fraction of a second later, she heard it again on the phone line. There was a pause. “Where are you, Miss Johnstone?” asked the voice on the line.

“I’m in the street on my mobile,” Aurora said. She started looking around. Further up the street, just past the crashed Toyota, she spotted a well-dressed woman with dark hair speaking on a phone and looking around, just like she was. Their eyes met. The woman raised her hand slightly in a small wave.

“Is that you?” Aurora asked. Even from the distance, she could see the smile on the woman’s face as she nodded.

“Yes, that’s me. What were the odds?” The line went dead in Aurora’s ear and she saw the other woman put her phone into her handbag. She pulled out some papers and spoke to the two people she was standing with. The taller of the two men was tall and angular and dressed almost like a character from a Dickens book. He even had long, dark sideburns that finished the look. On second glance, Ellie Patterson’s clothes were almost like a ‘light’ version of the same sort of style: like she wanted to dress the part but also didn’t want to stand out too much on the street. The shorter man was dark-skinned and with his hair tied back. He made no pretence with his dress. It was exactly what she might expect to see if he was a student at the university. They had a short, animated conversation. Aurora supposed that she was filling them in. Ellie pointed in her direction and the other two looked and then they all fell into step and walked to where the police officer had replaced the traffic barrier.

As they got closer, Aurora realized that the dark-skinned man wasn’t that much older than she was. Not a boy, but he couldn’t have been more than twenty-one or twenty-two. She pulled her eyes away and felt a bit of a flush in her cheeks. He really was quite good-looking. There was an intelligence in his jet-black eyes. She patted at her own unruly hair.

*What is wrong with me?* she thought. Aurora had never felt like that before. It was unnerving.

“Rora, who are these people?” asked Jimmy. Aurora had forgotten her brothers were there.

“My name is Lawrence Beattie,” said the Victorian man. He held out a hand to Aurora, and she shook it. He then waited a moment, but she didn’t say anything in reply. She was trying not to look at the young man, but that left her no option but to look at this Mr. Beattie, and his clothing left her speechless. “And you are Miss Aurora Johnstone. Pleased to meet you and you are?” He turned to her brothers, who introduced themselves.

Ellie Patterson she had already met on the phone, and Nick Jackson shook her hand as well. Ellie clicked her tongue as she read the papers that she had pulled out of her handbag.

“Would you look at that? Her address is just up the street. I never noticed.” She looked up and indicated the papers. “It’s your resume. Dr. Sutcliffe forwarded it. Very unusual for a girl your age.”

Nick spoke up. “Mr. Beattie, if you’re alright with things, I told a friend I would meet them tonight.”

“Yes, we’re quite alright here, Mr. Jackson. We will expect you bright and early tomorrow. It’s going to be a very big day.” Nick nodded to Aurora and she felt a little twinge in her belly when their eyes met. He turned and walked back into the police scene before disappearing behind the wall that the car was crashed into. A few minutes later, Aurora spotted Nick leave again, with his coat, a backpack and an umbrella.

“We have a particular research project underway, Miss Johnstone. Would you have time to speak to us about it?” It took Aurora a moment to realize that ‘Miss Johnstone’ meant her.

“What? Oh, um…” she looked at her brothers. They were starting to look bored. There really wasn’t anything happening. The fire was under control now and there wasn’t much to see. That brought her back to reality. Father dying and mother in hospital. *What is wrong with me? It’s like I can’t keep anything straight.* She spoke to her brothers. “Can you two go back to the house? Someone might call. If the hospital calls, you make sure you call me on my cell.”

“Sure, Rora,” said Jimmy. “Can we watch movies while we wait?”

“Okay. Nothing too scary. I’ll be home soon.” She waited until the boys disappeared through the front door of their house before she followed Mr. Beattie and Ellie.

## Chapter Seven: Hide and Seek

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick took the bus directly to the University. He called his parents on the way there. He filled them in with what had happened and where he was going. Yes, he would get himself some dinner at the SUB. No, he wouldn’t be too late. No, he wouldn’t drink too much. No, it wasn’t a date, he was meeting Richard. He had sensed more disappointment from his mother. He put his parents out of his mind as he hung up the phone and texted Richard to let him know he was going to be at the pub a bit early. The reply came back immediately.

*I’m already here. Want me to order you anything?*

Nick ‘ordered’ a Canterbury and a club sandwich. He didn’t know exactly how long the bus would take, and figured a sandwich wouldn’t get cold if it was ready before he got there.

His head was buzzing with the events of the day. It seemed like such a long time since he’d been on the bus that morning. He was excited at the prospect of placing the sensors in the forest. He was a little nervous about it too: what if it didn’t work? He was betting a lot of Mr. Beattie’s money on an idea that he’d cooked up in very little time. He didn’t think he would sleep much tonight.

And then there was the girl, Aurora. He’d read through her resume. It wasn’t very long, but she had evidently been hanging around the bio labs for a couple of years. Funny that he’d never noticed her there. The faculty was big, though and the labs were over a lot of floors in the bio buildings. She probably did a lot of work remotely anyways, being in high school and all. She was cute. Her hair. He touched his own unconsciously. When he didn’t tie it back, it turned into an unruly mess, sort of the same way hers was. But his was pure black, and hers was a fascinating dark red. *Auburn, I think they call it.* She was a slight and pale thing, but there was an intensity to her. It was something, anyways. Nick didn’t normally think too much on a girl after meeting her unless she was special.

It took another fifteen minutes for the bus to reach the University. The stop was a short walk from the SUB, and in a minute more, Nick was in its moodily-lit, low-rent interior. It was a thin Wednesday night crowd. It was the summer semester and the crowd was always thinner in the summer. It was such a relief that the SUB was open again: it had been closed for over a year until the government had let it open. Nick had shown his vax record at the door before entering.

The crowd was almost exclusively students, the ages of the patrons were pretty uniform. Everyone sat in their own cliques. There was no one sitting and drinking alone. Well, almost no one: Nick spotted Richard waving from a table near to the pool table. There was a short line of loonies on the edge of the table. They should get in line to play a game.

Nick slid into his chair, putting down his backpack and balancing his umbrella on it. A pint glass of dark beer and a club sandwich were waiting for him. A half-glass of beer was in front of Richard, and a few nachos left on the plate.

“Hola, Ricardo!” said Nick.

“Hola, mi amigo,” said Richard in reply. Richard was originally from Mexico, but downplayed his origins most of the time. He and Nick felt it was their inside joke. Richard had the best Spanish looks, but not a trace of an accent. “What was up with you this morning. Your texts were crazy talk, you know that, right?” He dipped a chip in the salsa and took a bite.

“Man, I don’t know where to begin,” said Nick. He lifted his glass and they clinked them together before he took a sip. It was inexpensive beer, but it tasted wonderful. The first bite of the sandwich was just as good. “This job. I don’t know what’s going on, but the people I work for, they’re keeping secrets.”

“What kind of secrets?”

Nick tried to lay out his thoughts as clearly as he could between bites of his sandwich. His first beer was gone before he finished. The weird dress code, the formality, the urgency that Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson seemed to have but were trying to keep from him.

“It’s almost like they are scared that something bad is happening and they are rushing to try to stop it.”

“With an entomologist,” Richard said dryly. “A third-year, piss-poor biology student.”

“Now you see it, too,” said Nick. “I’m serious. They aren’t just looking for some kind of invasive species. Something bad is happening and they’re…”

“They’re what?” asked Richard.

“I don’t know. Using me?” He said it as a question, but he didn’t think it was the right word.

“You know what it sounds like?” Richard waited for an answer, but Nick had none. “A double-blind. You know, research. Not quite, but you get the idea.”

“What, they are setting me up to find something?”

“Sounds like it. But they don’t want to taint you. You document everything do the work, and BAM! You stumble on what they knew you would find.”

“That’s stupid,” scoffed Nick. “What about the whole ‘escalating’ comment? If bad things were happening that they could stop, they would, right?” Another beer arrived. It tasted just as good as the first.

“Bad things *are* happening, Nick. You just finished telling me about them.”

They argued about it for a while. When it was their turn, they continued the argument at the pool table. In the end, Nick didn’t feel any better about it. He still didn’t understand what part he was supposed to be playing.

“You just be careful, okay man?” said Richard as they parted ways at the bus stop. “There are people dying. Even if it’s all coincidence, there are people dying around you. Don’t become a statistic.”

“You got it. See ya.”

“See ya.”

Aurora closed the front door of her house and kicked off her shoes. She clutched an SD card in her hand and her thoughts whirled in her head. It took some time before she remembered to take off her coat and check on the boys. Sure enough, it was a horror movie that was playing on the TV with them hiding behind the couch, watching over the back.

“Bedtime,” she told them as she thumbed the remote and the screen went dark. “Did anyone call?”

“Mom called,” said Jimmy. Aurora’s heart lurched.

“Why didn’t you call me?”

“Nothing to call you about. She just said Dad was still the same.” That was some good news. “We had mac’n’cheese. There’s some in the pot if you want some,” said Jimmy. Mr. Beattie had provided a number of finger foods as they had gone through the onboarding process and they had showed her the images from the sensors.

*I have my first job,* Aurora thought. It didn’t feel real yet. But she would actually get paid. It was a contract for two weeks, but could be extended depending on the project. She had work to do. She fingered the SD card. It had the test images that the team had made during the day, including when they had been testing throwing small objects through the air over the sensors. She would make a little bit of money at this job. That might help her get other jobs. Maybe she could save enough to pay for tuition and books next year even if things went really bad.

It gave her a pang of sadness to think it, but she didn’t want her future to get derailed by anything.

Soon the boys were brushing their teeth and heading to bed. Aurora closed her door and turned on her desk light and her laptop. As she waited for it to boot, she thought about what Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson had said. And what they hadn’t said.

As they had started to describe what they hoped the sensors would pick up once they were placed, Aurora had started to put two and two together. They were talking about an invasive insect species. That was where Nick came in. But she couldn’t help but think that the parameters of their hunting sounded a heck of a lot like… She had trouble thinking it, even now. *Like pixies. Or faeries, they’re the same size or thereabouts.* But that didn’t make sense. *Or did it?*

Lily had told her so long ago that their people were new to the forest, and had made their way there from Cornwall. What other way was there to describe them but as an invasive species? They flew. They were about the size that Mr. Beattie had described to her.

There were two explanations. The first was what they said at face value: there was an invasive insect species in the forest and they needed to find it. The other was that Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson suspected that there were small, supernatural beings living in the forest and they wanted to prove it. Occam’s razor pointed in the direction of the first option. But Aurora could not discount the possibility that this was a chance for her to apply scientific rigor to a half-remembered delusion from her childhood.

She popped the card into the slot on her laptop. The card appeared in the system, and Aurora started looking through them. The shapes of Ellie, Mr. Beattie and Nick were ghostly, almost looking supernatural themselves. The sensors were going into the forest tomorrow. By the next day, she would have a large set of images of whatever tripped the motion detectors. *What would they find?*

Aurora got up from her desk chair and went to stand at the window. Night had fallen, and the forest out back was only a dark formless mass. What was hiding there? She stood for a long time as the night grew deeper. Soon she couldn’t see the trees at all, just a shadow against the city lights reflected in the sky.

She heard her Mom come home just after ten. Her footsteps came up the stairs and stopped in front of Aurora’s door, but there was no knock, no words through the door. Soon the footsteps continued along the hall to her own room and there were the sounds of her getting ready for bed. Then the house was silent again.

Aurora went back to work.

Nick got to Mr. Beattie’s house early the next morning. He had ridden his bike more quickly than usual, eager to get here and start deploying the sensors. He was surprised to find the redheaded girl, Aurora, there before he was.

“Hi,” he said as he came in and put his cycling helmet on his desk. Aurora had set up on the work table. She had an older MacBook, coated with stickers. He thought he recognizes some Miyazaki characters, and a few others from Japanese anime. She looked up and smiled but her eyes only met his briefly. She turned her attention back to her laptop.

“What are you working on? The image analysis stuff?”

“Yes,” she said. “I’ve got some things working. Still a lot of work to do.”

“Cool.” He didn’t know what else to say. “You like working with computers, huh?”

She didn’t turn towards him. Her bushy crown of dark red curly hair hid her face. “Yes. I am interested in a lot of things.” Her voice was soft, like she hardly ever raised it. Nick looked around, but Miss Patterson wasn’t there yet, and neither was Mr. Beattie.

He lowered his voice. “What do you think is going on here?” he asked. That got her attention. She turned and looked at him, brushing her hair back. Her eyes were blue and they had instantly turned from that shy avoidance to piercing in a moment.

“What do you mean,” she said.

“I mean…” He didn’t know what to say. He had been thinking about this weird situation for a week, but she was barely starting. “I mean, what do you think we’re doing here? What are we looking for?” He fought against adding this, but he couldn’t help it. “Why am I in charge?”

A smile made a dimple in Aurora’s cheek. Her eyes scrunched up a little, moving the freckles around on her face. “We’re looking for bugs, right? You’re an entomologist, or so they tell me. What’s wrong with that?”

“Yeah, but…” he shifted uncomfortably. She wasn’t picking up on what he was asking. Maybe she hadn’t seen enough to start to question things. “I’m a third-year undergrad. Not an entomologist.”

“Fresh eyes. An open mind. And probably cheaper than hiring a seasoned pro,” she said. Nick felt a flush in his cheeks. He thanked the stars that his skin tone hid blushes. “I mean, look at me. Not even out of high school.”

“Young and hungry to prove yourself?” Nick asked.

“Sounds about right.” Aurora turned back to her computer just as the door to the office opened. Miss Patterson came in first, followed by Mr. Beattie. They were both dressed for a day in the woods. Miss Patterson has eschewed her usual long skirt for some trousers. Her hair was up in a neat bun at the back of her head. A hat was in her hand. Mr. Beattie was ready for a safari, as usual. His tall boots were shined to a mirror finish, though. Nick marvelled at the dedication the man had to his sense of style. On Monday, Nick had run into a man in the main part of the house who had turned out to be Mr. Beattie’s valet. Nick had never seen him before, and the man seemed almost embarrassed to be seen. Nick wondered how many people worked here, all helping Mr. Beattie live his personal lifestyle.

“Mr. Jackson, good to see you,” said Mr. Beattie, beaming. “No sense in dilly-dallying then. We three will see about our task, while Miss Johnstone sees to hers. Are you ready to depart?” Nick nodded and got up from his spot next to Aurora and moved to grab one of the three knapsacks they had loaded with sensors the previous day.

“We each have our route,” said Miss Patterson, handing Nick a piece of paper. There was a list of eight sets of coordinates and a map with a red line showing the route Nick was to take when deploying the sensors. “We should have them in place before noon.” Her tone changed: it was even more serious.

“Each of us will text the others after each sensor is placed. We will share our locations at all times while we are in the forest. If there is anything dangerous, you are to call either Mr. Beattie or myself immediately. Are you clear on the rules?” She stared at Nick until he nodded. He was taken aback: after all, he had been one of them making the rules yesterday. “Good. Then let’s be on our way.”

Nick looked to Aurora. She was watching, but saying nothing. Her eyes were unguarded again, searching the faces of Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson. *She isn’t taking this at face value, either,* he thought. She seemed sharp. He needed to have some more time to talk to her.

The three of them left, walking up the street one of the entrances to the natural area, and then they parted ways.

“Remember, regular communications,” said Miss Patterson. Nick smiled and fished his phone out of his pocket and waggled it at her.

They started in their directions, and Nick started in his. He was walking towards the first point in as near to a straight line as he could accomplish. He remembered to watch for any unusual nests or swarms, but he didn’t see anything worth noting. They were still in the part of the forest that they had surveyed earlier in the week, and not much had changed.

The first sensor location wasn’t far. Nick figured that his entire walking route would be less than a couple kilometers in total. He would take more time situating the sensors than moving between locations. When the coordinates on his phone lined up with the ones on his paper, he started looking around for a good spot to position the sensor.

It was relatively small: eight of them only occupied a corner of his pack. It had a strap that he could use to attach to a branch. The camera could take a picture on the same side as the motion sensor. If he strapped it to a tree, then it would only monitor the side of the tree it was on. A branch higher up, and he would have to choose if the sensor was facing up, down or to one side or the other. If he placed it on the ground, there seemed to be more of a chance of it being disturbed or tampered with.

The first set of coordinates were at the edge of a steep slope that didn’t have any trees on it due to the rockiness. Nick judged that the best choice here was to strap the sensor to a branch and have it facing up the slope. There was a large open area and clear lines of sight. He shimmied up and managed to crawl out onto the branch and place the sensor. He then pulled the camouflage net around it: Miss Patterson had suggested putting a small effort into hiding the devices.

When Nick jumped down and looked back up, he was happy with the result. Then he realized that he was going to have to climb up there every day and get the SD card out. He swore to himself. “Next one, make it easier to get to,” he muttered. He wrote down a description of where he had installed it, took a picture with his phone and then moved on. He almost forgot to text to the others, but when one arrived from Miss Patterson saying that she had placed her first sensor, he remembered and replied back with the same.

It was almost noon by the time Nick had placed the last sensor. He was sweating. His route had taken him mostly uphill and across a number of open, rocky areas. It was a warm day, and the humidity of the rains the day before was hanging in the air. He was now in a part of the forest where he hadn’t been before. He stopped before texting to Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson to mop his forehead with the hem of his shirt. *I’m sure Mr. Beattie would have used a silk handkerchief,* he thought with a smile.

He hadn’t seen anything unusual. There had been a bit of wind damage to some trees, and the mushrooms feasting on the fallen logs had been fascinating to him. Nick supposed he should have been disappointed to see nothing: the reason that he was employed by Mr. Beattie for the semester was to find something. Perhaps one of the others found something on their treks. From this vantage, the view to the south and west was impressive. He could see over the tops of trees, to the roofs and taller buildings beyond. Beyond that, the sun was glinting off the water of the Salish Sea and the Olympic Mountains were hiding in the haze in the distance. The sun felt good on his face, and Nick took a moment to soak it in.

Then something happened. He didn’t see or hear anything, but it seemed like the sun wasn’t quite as warm as it was. A chill started to creep into him. Nick looked around, but there was nothing to see. The sun was just as bright, but it didn’t seem to reach him as strongly. A growing sense of unease started to fill him. It was like there were eyes watching him, but he couldn’t see any watchers.

*You’re being ridiculous,* he thought, but he couldn’t shake the feeling.

He pulled out his phone and texted to Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson that he was finished and heading back. He kept looking up from his phone, trying to see what was causing him to feel so uneasy. Checking the map on his phone, he realized he was much closer to a different entrance to the natural area. Not too far down this hill he should find a path, even. It would mean a longer walk on the streets to get back to the office, but at the moment, the shorter route out of the forest seemed like a good idea.

Suddenly, Miss Patterson’s reminders to check in regularly didn’t seem so much like mothering. Nick felt alone. He was a stranger in a place that he didn’t belong. If anything were to happen to him, no one would know.

He got his bearings and then put the phone away and shouldered his now-empty pack. The uneasy feeling put speed into him, but the slope was hazardous. The surface was a mix of exposed bedrock and tufted grass clinging to every place that could have been a good foothold. He slipped twice, but never fell. As he plunged under the canopy of the trees again, the sensation of watchers grew. Still Nick could see nothing, no one. His breathing started to become ragged as he hurried through the woods. The terrain was still heading down. At some point, he had to reach the path. The path would lead him out of these woods; it would lead him to safety.

Panic was just starting to grip him, when he came across a gully in the side of the hill. It wasn’t large, but it had a trickle of a stream in it. The air immediately felt wetter and more chill. The grasses were replaced by mosses and ferns, but most importantly, the eyes disappeared.

Nick came to a stop, looking around. The invisible eyes weren’t there any more. The fear that he had been feeling was draining away, leaving peace in its place. He could hear birdsongs, and the rustling of the leaves in the canopy of the forest. The stirrings of small, unseen animals were the only other sounds he could hear over the trickle of water.

“That was fucking weird,” he breathed. His respiration was coming down to normal. He waited a minute more, but the sense of dread and fear stayed away. He pulled his phone out again, and dropped a pin on the map at his location. He had to remember this place. Something told him it might be important. He would definitely mention it to the others. Maybe they would consider putting a sensor here.

The young man hitched up his pants and continued downhill parallel to the gully, and five minutes later was rewarded with a rough hiking trail running in the direction he was expecting. It wasn’t an easy walk to follow it, but it was faster than cross-country. In a further ten minutes Nick was exiting the forest, returning to the familiar environs of the streets of suburban Victoria.

## Chapter Eight: Changing Plans

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick, Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson all arrived back at the office before noon. All twenty-four sensors were now deployed, and they had to wait. The plan was to leave them until the following morning. They would follow new paths to all of the devices, and swap the memory cards and batteries for each unit. Until then, all they could do was wait.

Nick was going to mention the strange feeling that had come over him after placing the last sensor, but lunch arrived via a delivery man. Soon they were all eating sandwiches and washing them down with selzer water. After the hike in the forest they were both welcome. As the food hit his stomach, the memory of the event started to get more distant. He couldn’t quite recall the sensations anymore. It started to feel a little silly, actually.

Aurora was still there, working away when they arrived and joining them for lunch. When lunch was done, Mr. Beattie asked for an update on her progress, so she started demonstrating what she had been up to.

Nick was sure his mouth was hanging open when she was done. He didn’t know what he was expecting but this girl took the goalposts and moved them so far down the field he couldn’t even see them.

“The first thing was a way to view the pictures from the camera in a way that made sense. Each picture is one hundred and eighty degrees. So instead of viewing a warped image and trying to figure what way is up, I’ve mapped each photo into 3D space, so you can look around in every direction with the mouse.” She demonstrated: it was like a video game, the distorted flat images from their testing were now easy to look at and navigate around. “I introduced a horizon line, because not all sensors will be upright. The orientation of the device is encoded in each image, so scenes where the camera is on its side, there will be data on one side instead of up.” She clicked a button and the scene changed, showing one of the tests where they had strapped the camera to the Smart board.

“Navigation I’m still working on, but I should have something before we get the field data tomorrow. At the moment, you need to know where each camera is in the field.” There was a window with a long list of image names, organized by the two cameras that they had been using for testing.

“The biggest challenge will be going through the images, looking for significant data.” Nick thought that she had already made that super easy. When he had been looking at the unprocessed images yesterday, it had given him a headache trying to figure out what he was looking at. Now it was like playing a video game. He could see this working. “Eliminating photos without anything significant will save a lot of time, but…”

“But we don’t want to throw out anything that might actually contain results,” said Mr. Beattie. He was fully engaged in the demo.

“R‚Äîright,” said Aurora. The interruption seemed to throw her off. For a moment, she was an eighteen year old girl, giving a presentation to strangers. Her eyes searched the faces of her audience uncertainly. But then she picked up her focus again and continued.

“I’ve tapped into Google’s machine learning framework. I’ve got an evaluation license, Mr. Beattie. It’s good for five hundred images, and I’ve used up most of that establishing a baseline.”

Mr. Beattie nodded, but didn’t interrupt this time.

“Anyhow, I’ve got it recognizing obvious things in the photos. Cats, birds, people. Squirrels. Anything that doesn’t fall into those categories with a ninety-seven percent certainty, it will flag for one of you to visually categorize. I know that we are looking for some kind of insect…” Aurora paused, as though waiting for some further hint from Mr. Beattie or Miss Patterson, but none came. “…so I have flagged anything insectlike as being for review. You might see a lot of dragonflies.”

Aurora seemed to be finished her demonstration. Nick wanted to clap, but restrained himself. He had never seen something like that from someone so young. To think that he had dismissed her for being a high schooler and a girl. He’d never said anything about it out loud to anyone, but he felt like he owed her an apology for thinking it.

_If anyone deserves their spot on the team, its her, not me,” he thought.

Miss Patterson spoke. “So how many images do we think we will have to visually categorize?”

“No idea, Miss Patterson. If the sensors are sitting in the woods and nothing trips them, then there’ll be nothing to work with.” Nick cringed inwardly at the thought. It was his suggestion to use the sensors and they had been hella expensive. “But assuming we get data to work with, the first bit will be more work: we’ll want to double-check the AI categorization before we fully trust it.”

Miss Patterson nodded.

“Good work. Amazing work,” said Mr. Beattie. Aurora’s cheeks flushed and she dropped her gaze. “I can see that Dr. Sutcliffe was correct in bringing you to our attention. I will have to thank him personally.” He clapped his hands and rubbed them together. “I am very much looking forward to this, but there is nothing to do now but wait.” He nodded towards Aurora, who had opened her mouth to speak. “Yes, I know you have a lot that you want to do. That’s not what I meant.”

“What about me?” asked Nick.

“Please assist Aurora in any way you can, Mr. Jackson,” said Miss Patterson.

“I can’t do anything like that,” Nick said, pointing at Aurora’s laptop screen. “That’s next-level.”

“Perhaps she will have questions about the research plan. Or information that you can help her look up.”

“Miss Patterson, I believe you have a list of things as long as your arm that I have been neglecting in favor of this project. Perhaps we could spend some time this afternoon covering the most urgent matters?”

“I don’t believe an afternoon will cover it, Mr. Beattie, but we could certainly get a start.”

“Miss Johnstone, if you need a license for this categorization AI stuff and you think it’s going to work for us, please let Miss Patterson know.”

They left, with Miss Patterson hustling Mr. Beattie when it looked like he was going to stop at the map and look at it for a bit. The office door closed, leaving Nick and Aurora.

“I’m just going to keep out of your way,” said Nick.

“That works for me,” said Aurora with a shy smile that took the sting out of the words.

“Where did you learn…” Nick waved a hand at her laptop, “… all of that? 3D visualization, machine learning to categorize photos. I mean what the. I thought you were still in high school.”

“I am,” she said. “I just, I have a…” she swallowed and suddenly the smiles were gone. “My dad has always been really supportive.”

“Yeah, my dad is supportive, too but Jesus. Are you like some kind of next-gen Steve Jobs or what?”

“Please, it would be Steve Wozniak, not Jobs,” she said with distain, but then giggled. “He was the engineer. I don’t think so. I just use the tools. There’s a shit-ton of stuff out there that is just magic. She patted her MacBook. “I’m standing on the shoulders of giants.”

“Must be a hell of a view from up there,” said Nick. Then he thought for a second, and double-checked the calendar hanging on the wall.

“Aren’t you supposed to be in school?”

Aurora looked away. Nick thought she looked guilty. “It’s only reviewing. Exams start in two weeks.”

“Shouldn’t you be… reviewing?”

Aurora fixed him with a stare. “I am helping the other kids review. I got this.”

“You’re already admitted to the University?” he asked. She nodded. “Assuming your final grades are good, right?”

“Look, what are you getting at?” Aurora turned back to Nick.

“I don’t know. Maybe I don’t know when to shut up.” *That is definitely a problem I have,* he thought. “But man… you’re going to go places. Wouldn’t want to screw that up at the last minute.”

Aurora stared at him for a long count. Nick knew he was going to get it with both barrels, somehow. But he wasn’t going to run away.

“I will have you know that what is going to ‘screw things up’, Mr. Jackson, is my father is currently dying of COVID in Victoria General. He dies, my family… well, my Mom made it clear there’s little chance of me going to University at all. So either I win big on a scholarship or I scratch enough money together to make tuition. I think I’ve got the exams covered, thank you very much.”

“Your dad is dying?” Nick asked softly. The anger drained out of Aurora. Her face went pale again. Suddenly, Nick noticed the shadows under her eyes, and read more into them.

“If anything is screwing my life up at the moment, it’s the Universe,” she said, this time quietly. “I can’t do anything to help him. I just want to keep my mind busy. If I work hard, then I don’t need to imagine the world without Dad in it.”

“Is that how you got so much done since yesterday? Did you even sleep last night?”

“Not much. I think I got fifteen minutes just after three.”

There was a silence then. Nick knew he needed to say something, but he was sure it was going to be the wrong thing again.

“I’m sorry,” he said. She looked surprised. Her eyebrows drew down in an unspoken question. “For assuming I knew what was going on with you. I hope your dad is alright.”

Aurora gave a sad smile.

“Is there anything I can do to help?” he continued.

“I just told you, there’s nothing I can do about it,” said Aurora.

“I meant with your app,” Nick said, indicating her laptop. It had long since gone onto its screensaver.

“Oh,” Aurora said with a half-smile. “Sorry. Shows where my head’s at. I don’t think so. I’m just going to keep working at it.” She checked her watch. It was a thick, chunky unit with a round face and bold numbers. “I’ve got just under three hours. I need to get home when my brothers get home from school. I figure I can work some more tonight. You are going to swap the memory cards in the morning?”

“Yep, and the batteries. You’ll be neck-deep in data this time tomorrow.”

“I better get to work then.”

Nick thought about the eerie feeling he’d had in the woods. “What do you think we’ll find?”

Aurora gave an exasperated sound. “You really don’t want me to get to work, do you?” There was an evasive look in her eyes, though. “It’s supposed to be bugs, right? I’m guessing bugs.” She punched her password in and her code editor showed up on the screen.

“Bugs doesn’t explain why *they* are so worried,” said Nick. He jerked a thumb in the direction of the office door and the other parts of the house.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Michelle Carson was home alone. That wasn’t unusual: it was a school day, her husband was at his job at the Canadian Tire and she worked shifts at the hospital. Tonight she started at seven, so she had slept most of the day but now was contemplating either having an early-afternoon breakfast or just putting it until off supper. It always seemed difficult to get the family together on these days when she worked the night shift. It was worth the effort to try to have one meal together per day.

She was about to make her decision and toast a bagel, when Rusty started whining. He was older now, and there was a fair bit of grey around his muzzle and he was starting to have issues with his hips. But he was part of the family and everybody loved him. He was an Irish Setter and slept most of the day. He had a soft mat in the hallway and was there now. A minute before, he had been asleep, with his nose tucked into his tail. Now Rusty was alert, with his head up, and was whining at the basement door. He hadn’t gotten up yet.

“What is it, boy?” asked Michelle. She listened for a bit. It was too early for either of the kids to be home from school. It was a quiet neighborhood and she didn’t really worry too much about her safety.

“Did you dream about chasing a squirrel?” she asked. Rusty looked at her, and licked his chops but then turned to stare at the basement door again.

Michelle was about to put it out of her mind and head to the kitchen when she thought she heard a sound like breaking glass. Immediately, she froze. Rusty got up from his blanket and moved to stand at the basement door. His whining got louder, and he pawed at the door experimentally.

Michelle felt cold. She eyed the dog, and then eyed the telephone.

*That sounded like it came from the basement,* she thought. But she wasn’t sure. It had been small, more like a teacup breaking than a pane of glass. *An intruder would make more noise, wouldn’t they?* They would if it was a TV show.

She listened some more, but she couldn’t hear anything over the soft sounds that Rusty was making. There were no sounds of movement or any thumps or bumps from the basement. She eyed the telephone one more time. If she called 9-1-1 and it was nothing, she would be so embarrassed. It might have been from outside.

Michelle moved around Rusty and put her hand around the doorknob. The basement door always made a lot of noise when it opened and shut, but that couldn’t be avoided. She turned the knob and grabbed a hold of Rusty’s collar before pulling the door open. The sound seemed louder than she expected.

The stairs to the basement were dark. The only light that she could see from below was natural: the basement windows didn’t have curtains. No one had turned on lights down there.

“Is anybody there?” Michelle called out. She was surprised at how unsteady her voice was. There was no answer. Rusty was pulling at her, trying to go down the stairs. He was huffing and obviously anxious to go down there and see what was there.

Michelle flicked the light switch on, illuminating the off-white walls and the blue-green carpet that had needed to be replaced since the 1970s. She and Rusty started down the stairs.

At the bottom was the laundry. The room was more of a storage room than anything, with overflowing shelves and stuff piled on the floor. Three bikes were there, propped up against boxes of Christmas decorations and other stuff. Nothing appeared to be amiss.

“Hello, is anyone there?” she called out, a little less shaky this time. Again, there was no answer. The back door was shut, and Michelle could see that the deadbolt lock was in the locked position. No one had come in that way.

Rusty gave an unexpected tug and Michelle lost her grip.

“Rusty! Get back here!” she said, but Rusty was hurrying forward, in a head-down, tail-down hunting mode. At least, that’s what he was trying to do, but with his hips it looked painful. He stopped at the open door to the furnace room, and stopped, frozen mid-stride. A growl rumbled in his throat.

“Rusty?” Michelle whispered, suddenly afraid. The furnace room was dark. The only lights in there were bare-bulb fixtures, turned on by dangling pull-chains.

Michelle crept closer to her dog, but wouldn’t dare stand in the doorway.

*This is stupid,* she thought. *I need to go upstairs and call 9-1-1.* She thought she heard a sound like the thrum of the wings of a small bird coming from the darkened room.

*A bird? Had a bird gotten inside their house?* That would explain Rusty’s behavior. He wasn’t acting like there was a threat. He was hunting.

She was screwing up her courage to enter the room and see if there was a bird in there, when there was a light from the darkness. It was orange, and it wavered, growing in brightness. It took her a moment to realize it was the light of a flame.

*A fire in my house!* Instantly her fear was transformed. She needed to get in there and put out the fire before it consumed her home. At a sprint, Michelle burst into the furnace room. There were more boxes in here, as well as the water tank. The original oil furnace that had been in the house when they’d bought it was replaced by a much smaller natural gas unit, meaning that the room was less crowded than it used to be. She fumbled for the chain on the light bulb and managed to yank it on the second try.

Flames were licking up the far wall. A stack of boxes of keepsakes was there. Already the cardboard was blackening. Smoke was gathering in the rafters. Michelle ran to it without thinking, but was forced back by the heat.

*Fire extinguisher,* came the thought. It was upstairs, in the vacuum closet.

She had barely turned around when the door to the furnace room slammed shut.

Michelle ran to it, and twisted the doorknob, but it wouldn’t turn. *This door can’t lock,* she thought. She could hear Rusty whining on the other side of the door. She twisted and pulled until her arms felt like they would come out of their sockets.

The smoke was getting thick. The heat from the flames was getting hot on her back but Michelle refused to turn and look. She kept trying to open the door.

She thought she heard a high-pitched laughter through the door as she slumped against it.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

“Hello, nine-one-one, what is your emergency?” Sandy adjusted the boom mic on her headset and then put her hands on her keyboard ready to work the incoming call.

“There’s a fire. A house on fire. I can see smoke coming out the roof, and there’s flames in the window!” The voice was excited. So many of them were. That was why Sandy had training in how to use her voice to help calm the caller and ask questions.

“I understand, sir. Do you know the address of the house?” She typed in the address in her computer-aided dispatch system, and a map showed up, showing the location. She was about to identify the event as a fire, but she noticed that there was another flame icon on the map, only one block away from the address the caller had given.

“Sir, can I ask you to confirm the house number for me? I have it as two-one-eight.” It seemed very likely that this was a second call on the fire event that had already been reported. One of the other call-takers must have taken it.

“Yes, that’s right. I can see the numbers on the front of the house. They are black and the stucco is white.” Sandy frowned. It seemed unlikely that there would be two fires so close to each other. *Maybe it’s the other call that is wrong.* The system was slowly triangulating the location of the call. It was a cellular call, on Rogers. The circle of the phone’s location was shrinking and it seemed as though the location was centering on the given address.

“Thank you for confirming that for me. Please stay on the line, I am notifying the Fire Dispatcher now.” Sandy flagged the event as a fire and pressed the button that would commit the call to the system. She muted her mic.

“Who took the call at 338 St. Nichols?” she asked. The other call takers were in pods that all adjoined. They all had three large monitors and there were transparent dividers between the workstations for the pandemic, but they were all able to hear each other.

Emmet raised his hand. He was still on a call, with the red light on the tip of his mic glowing. Sandy couldn’t ask him any more questions. Having two fires so close… She thought of the stories in the news about the arsons. Most of them had come on other peoples’ shifts at the call center, but what if… She unmuted her line.

“Hello sir, dispatch has been notified. There will be a response in a few moments. Can I ask you to do something for me?”

“Yes, yes. Oh God, I don’t know if there’s anyone in there. Should I try the front door?” said the caller. He sounded young. Maybe in his twenties, if she was any judge.

“No, sir. Nothing like that. I would like you to look up the street. Towards the northeast. Can you tell me if you see anything unusual?”

“Yeah, yeah. Sure.” There was a pause. “Hey, there’s some smoke coming from that way too. Do you need me to go and see what that is?”

“No, sir. Thank you sir for confirming that for me,” Sandy said. She muted her line as she noted the information in the call report. She leaned back in her chair to speak around the divider to Chris in the next pod. It was hard enough being understood with the mask on without having the divider in the way.

“Two fires? What is that about?” she asked. Sandy pointed at the big situation map on the wall. There were two flame icons practically on top of each other. Chris shook her head. She pointed at the fourth of their number, Carl, who had just received a call as well.

“Look at that,” said Chris. Another flame icon appeared, next to the first two.

“Jesus,” said Sandy. She went back to her call. The event was assigned to the fire department and units were dispatched. Units were brought in from neighbouring halls to cover the three fires. This was unprecedented.

Aurora was completely zoned into her work when the door to the office banged open and Miss Patterson rushed in. Aurora finished her line of code and immediately put a ‘TODO’ flag at the spot, just in case she forgot exactly where she had been.

Miss Patterson didn’t say anything, but swept to the Smart board and immediately traced along one of the streets in the map of the forest. It was on the near side of the forest that she was looking closely at.

Aurora looked at Nick, who had sat up and was watching Miss Patterson as well. They shared a look. Nick shrugged. He had been spending time researching the natural insect species of southern Vancouver Island. Tomorrow, he would have to lead the team in identifying anything that the sensors picked up. Aurora was going to harness machine intelligence as much as she could, but they would need regular old human intelligence if they were going to make any headway.

Miss Patterson ran her finger over the circles on the map showing the sensor locations and then put her hands on her hips, staring at the board. Twice, Aurora thought she was going to say something, but neither time did she say anything.

Just then, Aurora could hear the sirens of fire trucks in the distance.

Nick opened his mouth to say something, but Mr. Beattie came in. He had his tablet out, and he went straight to the board to stand next to Miss Patterson. His eyes were worried above his black silken mask, monogrammed in gold.

“We’ve got three near,” said Miss Patterson. She said it for Mr. Beattie to hear, but there was no other sound in the office to cover it.

“You’re sure?” Mr. Beattie asked. He held up his tablet, and grabbed the virtual red pen. The red stars he’d placed at the sites of the house fires were still there. He quickly scribbled three more red stars along the same street. *This street. My street,* thought Aurora. He put the virtual pen down and tapped the three blue circles indicating the three sensors closest to the red stars. The sensors that they had just placed this morning. She checked her watch. Barely four hours ago, actually.

“What now?” asked Miss Patterson.

“What’s happening?” asked Nick.

“More fires?” asked Aurora. She jumped up from her chair and came close enough to make out the locations that Mr. Beattie had marked on the map. They were a little further away, but still on this street, bordering the forest. *Not my house.*

“More fires,” said Mr. Beattie. “Just came over the fire radio channel. The fire trucks are on their way.”

Aurora looked at Nick. She could see him fighting with the urge to say something. *He definitely isn’t the sort to hold his tongue. What will he say?*

“Mr. Beattie, can I ask a frank question?” Nick said. Aurora congratulated herself at predicting it.

“I don’t think we can continue as we have been, Lawrence,” said Miss Patterson to Mr. Beattie, seemingly ignoring Nick’s question.

Mr. Beattie ground his teeth but didn’t say anything. Eventually he unclenched his jaw. “You may ask, Mr. Jackson.” Each word was sharply-defined. Aurora didn’t think she’d heard such controlled anger before. She doubted that she would have the courage to go ahead, but Nick did.

“You put three more fires on the map. That means there have been seven fires and five other deaths and other near-misses in the past two weeks.”

“Go on,” said Mr. Beattie.

“Are you going to tell me that we are still looking for insects? That ain’t coincidence, that’s a pattern.” Nick raised his chin in challenge when Mr. Beattie turned from the map to face him.

“We…” Mr. Beattie swallowed, collecting his thoughts.

Aurora felt a surge of emotion. There was a singular moment of clarity for her. It suddenly became clear why he had been asking the questions he had. He thought there was something in the forest, too: something dangerous. The thing was, Aurora had experienced something dangerous in the forest, ten years ago. Her world spun. Here she was, just helping out, working the first day of her first job, and suddenly this all comes full circle?

*Did Mr. Beattie know something that he wasn’t sharing? Did he suspect that…*

“Are you familiar with the phrase ‘Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,’ Mr. Jackson?” asked Mr. Beattie.

Nick didn’t answer, but Aurora did. “Sagan,” she said softly. When the eyes of the room turned to her, she spoke more clearly. “Carl Sagan.”

“Indeed, Miss Johnstone. And the basis of that statement?”

“If you are going to make a claim, like you figured out perpetual motion, you are going to need to provide iron-clad proof of it.”

“Exactly. And this is exactly where conspiracy theorists and crackpots fall down,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how *sure* you are of something. If you are going to make your mark on the Universe, it’s done with rigor. Part of that rigor is following a plan. Not taking short cuts. Not jumping from step A to step Z without all the steps in between.” He said the last as much to Miss Patterson as to Aurora.

“People are *dying*, Lawrence.” Mr. Beattie winced when Miss Patterson said it.

“That is… not my fault.”

“But we might be able to stop it.”

“Can someone please just tell me what’s going on?” said Nick.

“There’s something in the woods that isn’t an insect, Nick,” said Aurora. “He doesn’t want to tell you. He wants you to make the discovery for yourself. Then it will be more legit. Isn’t that right, Mr. Beattie?”

“Miss Johnstone, I would ask you to please stop this line of conversation,” he said. His brows were furrowed and he was looking at her quite seriously. “I have no idea exactly what you know or think you know, but I would like you to keep it to yourself.”

“The woods aren’t safe, Lawrence,” said Miss Patterson. “You can’t ask Nick to go out there on his own any more.”

“*Miss Patterson*,” Mr. Beattie said with annoyance, “I would appreciate a little decorum in your address. I am fully aware that the risks have changed. Are changing. When we started this, there was only one unexplained fire. Now… now things have changed. You are right, the forest is dangerous, but we can’t play it both ways!” He raised his voice in exasperation.

“We can either back away and say it’s too dangerous, or we can follow through and perhaps solve this. Which is it?” He challenged Miss Patterson.

“Does this have something to do with the eyes in the forest?” asked Nick.

“What was that?” asked Aurora.

Nick was hunched in on himself and staring out the windows to the sunlit gardens.

“Eyes?” asked Miss Patterson.

“It… it was this morning, just after I placed the last sensor.” Nick tried to tell them what he had felt as the sensation had chased him out of the forest. “It went away suddenly, like it had never been.”

“I don’t know about any eyes,” began Mr. Beattie, but Aurora had moved past him to see the board. She knew the locations of the sensors and her eyes picked out the last one that Nick had placed.

“Then that sensor might have images on it,” she said.

“They all might, but we’re not getting them until tomorrow, that’s the plan,” said Mr. Beattie.

“Oh, and how many might get hurt before then, *Mr. Beattie*?” Miss Patterson asked with a touch of acid. “There are three sensors that are close to the fire reports.” The sounds of the fire truck sirens had stopped while they had been arguing, but Aurora had no doubt that right now chaos was reigning down the street as the fire fighters worked to fight three separate blazes. “Add to that the one that Nick placed, and I’d say we would be off to a great start.”

“And to what end?” Mr. Beattie said, a touch of petulance. “We had a plan. We would slowly, carefully collect evidence until there was no doubt. And then we would take it public. This isn’t careful, it’s running off half-cocked. And even if we get incontrovertible evidence, then what?”

“We take it to the authorities,” said Miss Patterson.

Mr. Beattie gave a bark of laughter. “And what then, the police will arrest them?”

“We can’t do anything, *Lawrence*. You know that. We need to involve the authorities. What about that Constable Jeffries you spoke with? She seemed to be in charge of the investigation.”

“Yes, I’m sure she’s at her wits’ end by now,” said Mr. Beattie.

“Arresting who?” asked Nick.

“Oh for the love of all that’s Holy,” said Mr. Beattie, standing up. “Here’s my bargain, *Ellie*. We will retrieve those four sensors’ memory cards. We will run the data through Aurora’s system. Is it ready?” he asked her as an aside. Aurora nodded. “Consider it a beta test. Then tomorrow, we continue with the plan, assuming that we don’t have any results that affect the plan. Will you give me some peace if we do that?”

“That’s fair,” nodded Miss Patterson. “But we three stick together.”

“I want to go,” said Aurora. She surprised herself by saying it. “I want to see this place where Nick felt the sensation of eyes.”

“Two teams of two, each getting two data cards, then,” said Mr. Beattie, though Miss Patterson looked doubtful.

“Should we call the Constable first?” asked Nick.

“I imagine we will run into her people when we retrieve the cards,” said Mr. Beattie. “We shan’t be alone in the woods.”

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick led the way to the first sensor. He hadn’t placed this one: it had been Miss Patterson’s. He had had to search for a bit: his phone told him he was at the right coordinates, but under the forest canopy it could be off by more than ten meters. In the end it was the photo that Miss Patterson had taken and shared that let him to it.

On the way to the forest entrance, he and Aurora had passed two emergency scenes, where fire fighters were working to extinguish two more homes. The smoke from a third was further along. The street had been full of people, residents he supposed, standing and watching their neighborhood being put to the torch. There were a lot of nervous and suspicious looks as he and Aurora had made their way through their midst.

Now that they were there, Nick thought that this might be important work that they were doing. Whether it was luck or intentional, Miss Patterson had strapped the sensor with its camera facing the line of homes. They weren’t directly visible from here, but if anyone was to travel through the forest to the closest burning house, there was a good chance they would have been seen by the camera. Nick’s hand shook a little as he extracted the SD card and replaced it with a new one. This tiny square of plastic might actually have evidence on it that would catch the arsonist.

Aurora wasn’t really paying attention. She was looking around, looking up in the canopy of the forest. She looked tense.

“One down,” said Nick. He slipped the card into the inside pocket in his light jacket.

“Where to now?” asked Aurora. Nick had to check the map on this phone before he pointed in the direction.

“If we bear a bit to the right, we will go by the gully and then up the slope to where the sensor is.” Aurora nodded. She had a set to her chin that spoke to Nick of determination. Nick only felt anxiety.

“I still don’t know what the hell is going on,” he said as the started to pick their way. “If we have evidence that might help the police catch the firebug, then why aren’t we going to them?”

Aurora didn’t say anything for a bit, but then spoke. “Because I think that we are walking in the world of the unknown. Laws might not apply.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” Nick swatted the branch of a bush away as it clung to him.

“I think that Mr. Beattie is trying to find something unexplained. I don’t know what started him chasing this. There has to be a reason, an inciting incident. But I barely know him.” Aurora was speaking as much to herself as to Nick. “Do you know why he started this research, Nick?”

“Hell no, I was just happy to get a co-op work term. I thought we were looking for insects.” He shrugged. “As far as anyone tells me, that’s still why I’m here.”

“Such an odd man. But hardly the type that would suddenly take an interest in bugs, don’t you think?” She didn’t wait for an answer. “It makes me think that maybe he had an experience. Something that happened to him. Something that he had to prove existed just so that he would know that he wasn’t crazy.”

Aurora’s indistinct rambling suddenly clarified. “It is a different way to process trauma. Just because it’s different than what I did, it doesn’t mean he’s wrong.”

“Wait, what happened to you?” Nick asked. He turned to look at the redheaded girl following him. She didn’t avoid his gaze, but she didn’t answer him, either.

“Let’s see that spot of yours first,” she said. “Then we’ll see.”

The land was rising. It wasn’t far to their goal. Now that Nick was starting to feel comfortable rambling around in it, it was starting to feel smaller and less mysterious. Given a couple more weeks, he might almost feel at home in it.

Nick checked his phone again, and swore. “We’re too far west,” he said. He had been aiming for the gully, but they were further up the hill than he’d planned. *Just when I thought I was starting to get confident.* “We’re closer to the sensor than the gully. We’ll go get the card first, okay?”

He led the way further to the left, and soon they were scrambling upwards. As they did so, the canopy of the forest failed and they were in the sunlight again. This was a sensor that Nick had placed, so there was no need to search for it. It wasn’t well hidden: at this location there hadn’t been a lot of options for placement. The best of his limited choices had been at the base of a tiny, gnarled oak sapling, no more than eight feet tall. Its roots were twisted into the cracks of the bedrock, desperately trying to find earth to dig into. The sensor was wrapped in its camouflage wrap, the lens glinting at him as he reached for it.

Flipping the unit over, Nick noticed a problem immediately.

“Huh,” he said. His fingers probed in the SD card slot to confirm what his eyes were seeing.

“What is it?” Aurora asked.

“The card. It’s gone.”

“Did it just fall out or something?” she asked.

“No,” said Nick. “There’s no way. The little door was open and everything. It’s waterproof, you need to flip this latch.” Despite himself, Nick looked around on the ground to see if he could see the telltale sign of pink and white plastic. *It’s not possible that it could have fallen out,* he thought.

Aurora came close to look. Nick demonstrated closing the flap and opening it again. He dug in his pocket and fished out the new card. There was no point in leaving the camera empty.

“Someone took it,” said Aurora.

“Yeah, but who?” asked Nick. “And they left the sensor. These things aren’t cheap. The SD card’s only worth about ten bucks.”

“Nick, I’m scared.” Her words drew his attention from the mystery of the missing card. Her face was white and her eyes were wide. The lack of blood in her face made her freckles stand out.

Then Nick felt it too. It was the same feeling that he had had earlier that morning, standing here. He looked around wildly, trying to find the source of the sensation. Then he started to feel like he couldn’t trust his eyes any more.

## Chapter Nine: Strange Revelations

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora had expected something would happen as soon as Nick said that the memory card was missing from the camera. There was only one explanation for that: the watchers had removed the card to sabotage their operation. No matter if the watchers were human or supernatural, it stood to reason that they would not take kindly to their return and attempt to repair their work.

And Aurora was sure that the watchers were the faeries. She had put this together from Mr. Beattie’s evasiveness and the connection to the fires. Ten years ago, a faerie named Dereg had had ideas about being able to fight back against the ‘big people’. He had been taken prisoner by his own people, but now Aurora wondered if he was at large again.

The fact that she was willing to consider this as the most likely option scared her. But right now, she was scared for her life. Anyone who was willing to destroy and kill the humans who lived next to the forest would have no compunctions about doing the same to two who wandered in. She tried to take courage in the knowledge that humans seemed to be immune to the faerie magic as long as they were aware and resisting it.

Aurora was about to say something to Nick, to warn him, when the world seemed to warp around her. Her eyes seemed to cross, and by the time she could make sense of the world around her, she was dizzy and staggering. Flashes of light assaulted her. She threw her arms up in front of her face to defend her face. Loud noises popped in her ears, and the combination of everything disoriented her.

Aurora felt her ankle twist as she stepped off a rock that she couldn’t see. The sharp pain focused her mind enough to cry out. “Stop it! Stop it!” It had no effect. Aurora fell to her knees from the pain in her ankle. She had no idea where Nick was.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick was in a black space. There were distant geometric shapes of light that moved in dizzying patterns. Sometimes they would all move together in one direction, and he would almost fall over from the disorientation.

“Aurora?” he called out. He couldn’t hear his own voice except for the sensation through his skull. *What is this?* he thought, panic rising. He staggered again from the disorienting lights. He could assume that the forest and the hill they were standing on was still there, but he could see nothing. “Aurora! Where are you?”

He tried to stay still, but he was having trouble understanding where he was. Nick could feel himself staggering. Fear gripped him that he might be near the edge of the hill. He couldn’t see.

Then suddenly, he could. The hilltop came back into view. Nick staggered back: he had been right at the edge of the hill crest. One more step and he would have tumbled down the rocky slope.

Nick turned and saw Aurora: she was lying, bleeding on the ground next to the stunted oak tree. She was looking at him, and holding a wound on her side.

“Aurora!” he yelled and started running toward her.

“Nick, no!” Aurora shouted and she held up her other hand to try and stop him. Then she said something that made no sense to him.

“Lily! Help us!” It made Nick slow a bit. He thought he heard some laughter, but when nothing happened, he picked up his running. Then the laughter stopped and many different things happened at once.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora held her ankle as she hunched on the ground. In between the flashes and the twisted warped view she had, she managed to see Nick. He was staring at nothing and waving his arms around as if he’d gone blind. His staggering motions were leading him in a drunken walk around the hill.

As Aurora gained a better sense of her surroundings, she tried to focus on denying these illusions. That had to be what they were. Maybe the flashes were real, but her best bet was denying that they existed. The faeries were attacking them. Aurora tried calling out to Nick, but he couldn’t seem to hear her. He shouted her name twice.

*If I get out of this, I swear I’m never going to doubt my memory again,* she thought. *Denial is a river in Africa.* There was no more doubt in her mind that they were in danger and from what. She still hadn’t seen any of their persecutors, but she knew they were there.

What had happened in the forest? She had left the pixies and the faeries behind on good terms. She had thought that their conflict was over. It was like a satisfying end to a dream. No matter how alarming parts of it had been, there had been an end. A lot could happen in ten years.

Nick was staggering towards her now, and away from the edge of the hill. That was a relief. It gave her time to think. She tried to rise, but the pain from her ankle was too much. She cried out in pain when she put weight on it and fell back down with a bump. It jarred her teeth. The illusions around her were weakening. It gave her hope. If she could dispel them entirely, she could focus on Nick. He was still staring blindly as he moved around.

Then his eyes suddenly cleared. He was facing the direction of the steepest part of the hill. He focused on something ahead of him. Aurora tried to figure out what he was looking at, but then Nick yelled “Aurora!” and started running towards the cliff.

“Nick, no!” Aurora yelled. She didn’t know what he was seeing, but it was an illusion. He didn’t slow. There was nothing she could do. Nick was about to throw himself into the air and fall to his death. As though they were confident in their victory and didn’t care if Aurora saw them, the faeries dropped their illusion hiding them.

The memories came rushing back to her as she saw physical evidence of her persecutors from ten years earlier. They were about the size of a child’s hand and shaped like slightly-built humans. Their clothing was drab greens and browns and would blend into the forest even without magic to hide them. Their hair was dark and cut short. But their distinguishing characteristic was a set of wings on each tiny person’s backs. They were insect-like, clear with veins giving them structure. They were all standing on the open ground of the hilltop, watching Nick run blindly off the hill. High laughter escaped them and chased Nick as he ran.

She didn’t have any other choice. If there was going to be one ally in the forest who could help, it had to be Lily. Aurora didn’t know if the girl was still in the forest at all or if she was within earshot, but there was nothing else for her to do. It was either stay silent and watch Nick die, or call for help.

“Lily! Help us!” she yelled. That made Nick slow for a moment. Aurora hadn’t realized that he could hear her now. One of the faeries looked back at Aurora in annoyance. Nick picked up his pace again, oblivious of the danger he was running towards.

Aurora was just inhaling to shout for Nick to stop when there was a shiny blur that streaked from her peripheral vision straight at Nick. At first she thought it was just another of the abberations that the faeries were introducing into her sight, but when the streak was almost at Nick, all of the flashes and sounds stopped. As one, four faeries yelled and launched themselves into the air.

Nick stumbled. But then the shiny blur grew. It grew from the size of a tiny bird to be the form of a young woman, perhaps a little smaller than Aurora. The woman flew forward with momentum, but was now a projectile on a ballistic path. She tackled Nick around his middle, knocking him flying and they both crashed to the ground, tumbling to a stop.

For a moment, they teetered on the edge of the drop, but then the slid over the side and out of sight.

Aurora struggled to a standing position, leaning against the tree for help. She balanced on one foot and hobbled to where Nick had disappeared. There was no sign of the faeries. They had disappeared again. Whether they were just hiding themselves or if they had left, Aurora had no way of knowing.

As she approached the hill’s edge, she saw two figures climb up and over it. Nick’s eyes were wide with confusion, and the young woman’s gaze immediately fixed on Aurora’s.

Ten years had passed, but there was no doubt in Aurora’s mind that this young woman was the person that Lily Merriweather had grown up to be. Her skin was pale, her hair was dark and her eyes were a matching brown. Her hair was cropped short in a messy, spiky way that Aurora was immediately envious of. Her clothing wasn’t the shimmering drapery that had been the regular wear of the pixies. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt in mid-brown and a tan pair of pants that tied at the waist and at the calves. Her figure had matured in the decade since Aurora had seen her, but she was thin, with her collarbone standing out from her shirt and her cheeks more hollow than healthy. A black tracing of a tattoo curled around her left temple and into her hair.

There were no wings showing. Aurora knew that Lily could hide them when she needed to pass as human.

Aurora hobbled to a stop just as Lily and Nick crested the edge of the hill. They were both dusty, and some of Nick’s hair had escaped his ponytail, but they didn’t look injured. Nick was leaning on Lily’s shoulder and didn’t appear to know where he was.

“Are you okay?” Aurora asked both of them.

Lily shot a look at Nick. “He’ll be fine. He’s doing all right considering the way those faeries were playing with him.” She moved away from Nick, who swayed a bit but managed to stand without falling down. “You look like you got the worst of it,” she said, pointing at Aurora’s ankle.

Aurora shrugged, but didn’t know what else to say. She stared at Lily, taking in the familiar face and as yet unfamiliar figure. They were about the same size, just like they had been before, but in Lily’s case her size was her choice.

“Thanks,” said Aurora. It was Lily’s turn to shrug. “Were… were you going to do something, or were you just going to…” Aurora let the sentence die away unfinished. Lily looked away, not meeting Aurora’s eyes.

“You were,” Aurora said. But then there was an interruption by an old man’s voice.

“She was told to.” Aurora recognized that voice. She hopped on her good foot to turn to see the newcomer.

He was old and gnarled as the oak tree next to him. He could have been eighty or ninety, with nothing on his figure except for sun-weathered skin wrapping a skeleton. His browned skin was covered liberally with black tattoos, of a variety of symbols and patterns. His head was bald but he held himself erect as though his obvious age had nothing to do with his strength. He was Solon, the widower of Lunid and another of the pixies.

“Now she has gone and started a fight,” Solon continued. He addressed Lily directly. “We have been able to stay here because we were strictly neutral, girl. Now that will be over.”

Lily looked angry, but didn’t answer. Her eyes glared at the old man.

Solon turned to Aurora and looked her up and down. “I recognize you,” he said. “Grown to a woman, now.”

“I recognize you, too, Solon,” said Aurora. “I seem to remember you being a fair bit braver when you were younger.”

“Bravery has nothing to do with it, girl,” he spat. “Things have changed. We do what we have to.” He looked around, scanning the sky and the tree line. He looked cautious. “You need to leave these woods. They aren’t safe for humans. I don’t know why you and your friends have been snooping so much lately, but all you’ve done is riled them up. And that’s making things worse. Get out and don’t come back.”

He turned and beckoned to Lily. “We will speak of the consequences of your rash actions. No apprentice of mine would do something as stupid as that.”

“Wait!” said Aurora. Solon ignored her. “I need your help. Please.”

“You needed our help. You got it. You won’t see us again. Stay out,” Solon said.

“But my ankle,” Aurora said. “I can’t get down this hill like this. Can’t you help?”

“That’s your problem,” seethed Solon. “I swear, if I could call those faeries back right now I would do so.”

“Master!” Lily said. She looked aghast at the old man.

“We are leaving, girl.” In a moment, he shrank down to pixie-size and his wings were back. A thrumming sound followed him as he streaked away from them, down the hill and into the trees.

Lily looked wild-eyed from Aurora to the place where Solon had disappeared. “I have to go,” she said in a strangled voice. In a twinkling, she crossed the space to where Aurora stood and gave her an unexpected hug. It was over in a second, then Lily dropped to one knee. She grasped Aurora’s injured ankle. There was a clap of sound and a warm impact feeling that caused Aurora to gasp. Lily rose again, then gave a sorrowful smile and then she too was transforming, shrinking down to a tiny size and flying away after Solon.

Aurora watched the spot where Lily had disappeared for a moment before tentatively putting her foot down. It was still sore, but she could put weight on it. She could walk.

“Will you please,” came Nick’s voice, “tell me what the hell I just saw?” Aurora jumped. She’d almost forgotten he was there. When she turned, she saw that he was standing there, holding his phone up, taking video.

## Chapter Ten: Confessions

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick wasn’t sure what was real any more. After the visual mindfuck he’d just been experiencing, the strange girl and old man *shrinking* and flying away seemed to be the least of the unbelievable things that he was trying to comprehend.

One moment, he’d been running to try to help Aurora, injured and bleeding, and the next he had been impacted by the girl. She had given him a tackle that would have done a football linebacker proud, driving the air out of him and sending them both tumbling. He was bruised and dirty from the experience, but then they had dropped over the edge and continued tumbling and rolling before coming to a painful stop. He thought he had managed to protect his head from any knocks, but we wasn’t sure any more. Seeing full-sized people shrink and fly away made him feel like perhaps his brain wasn’t fully intact.

It was an instinctive reaction: he pulled out his phone and started filming. He held the phone inconspicuously, but no one was paying him any mind. The old man was angry for some reason, and the girl who had tackled him was letting him get away with it for some reason.

Then they disappeared. Nick almost dropped the phone when it happened. One moment the old man had been there, and then he was gone. Then the girl followed, but not before giving Aurora a hug.

He had no idea what he was seeing. None of it made any sense. He said as much, surprising Aurora. She walked to him, with a limp. She ran her hands over his arms, looking into his eyes.

“Are you alright, Nick?” she asked. “Look at my finger.” She held up her index finger in front of his eyes. He focused on it as she moved it. She dropped it with a smile. Then her smile slipped, and she was looking around.

“We need to go, now.” She sounded worried. Nick supposed he should feel worried, but he felt more dazed. Or drunk. Like he’d had a couple of shots and the world didn’t seem quite so important at the moment.

She didn’t wait for an answer. Nick followed after the red mop of hair, shining in the early summer sun. Her hair was fun. It bounced and moved. Not like his hair. He kept it tied back. It was a contradiction, wasn’t it? Why did he have his hair long if he always kept it controlled? *Why am I suddenly preoccupied with my hair?* Some things didn’t have answers.

Aurora was moving quickly down the hill, sliding down the steeper parts. Nick needed to focus. It was difficult. If he had seen those things and they were real, who was to say what was real and what wasn’t? It was a philosophical battle with himself and he was falling behind Aurora until the slope flattened out and his longer legs could eat the ground quicker. He caught up and the questions started pouring.

“Who were they?”

“Who?” Aurora answered. “The old man and the woman?”

“Yeah, although I think I have a bone to pick with whoever was laughing up there, too.”

“Solon was the man. Lily was the woman.”

“This is going to sound silly, but they aren’t human, right?” It was more blunt than he would have liked, but right now his brain wasn’t ready for subtlety.

“No.”

“Why are you taking all this so calmly? I’m freaking out here.”

“Because I knew them a long time ago,” Aurora said the last quietly.

“That seems unlikely. I’d say the whole thing seems unlikely. Can you start at the beginning?” Just bombarding her with questions didn’t seem to be working out.

“I only remember some of it,” said Aurora. “I was eight. And I didn’t believe any of it. I think my brain forced me to forget a lot of what happened. Almost like self-defense.”

“Ten years is a long time,” agreed Nick. They were coming to the gully where the eerie sensation of being watched had gone away that morning. “Hey, remember I told you about the place where…”

She didn’t let him finish. She whipped her head around to look at him. “The gully, you said. Can you show me?”

“Yeah, it’s just over that way.” Nick pointed to their left. “Not too far past that is a trail.”

They walked in that direction. Aurora kept talking. “My brothers got kidnapped. No, before that there was a mysterious girl who kept coming to visit me, but we didn’t know where she lived.”

“We?” asked Nick.

“My Dad and me. We went into this forest looking for the path she might have been using to visit me.”

“You live in one of the houses backing onto the forest? Aren’t you worried about that?”

“I’ve got enough to worry about at the moment,” said Aurora with a bitter tone. “My brothers got kidnapped, and then I… I did too. Lily, that woman back there, she was the girl and when things went sideways she came and got me before the others did.”

“The others?” asked Nick.

“Faeries.” It looked like Aurora was resisting saying it aloud. “I know it sounds stupid. Believe me, I know. It’s embarrassing.”

“Lily is a faerie?” asked Nick.

“Oh god, no,” said Aurora. She stopped. They had made it. This was the same place, with its trickle of water and moss and ferns. She inhaled sharply. “This is it,” she breathed. Nick watched as Aurora moved down into the gully a ways, looking around and up.

“There’s two groups,” she continued. “They both moved here a while back. I understand they had a truce for a while, but then one of the faeries got an idea into his head. They attacked the pixies and kidnapped my brothers.”

“What’s the difference?” asked Nick.

“You know, I couldn’t tell you,” said Aurora with a shrug. “But there was a war of sorts. The old man, Solon, his wife was a powerful spellcaster. She ended it, but died. At one point, I was here. They call this place Rainbow Ravine. When you’re the size of a pixie,  it seems much grander.” She smiled. She glanced at Nick with a shy look.

“Something has gone wrong here,” she said. “The war was over and there was a new peace. The faerie leader was a prisoner. But this… this is wrong. Something has gone wrong. The fires, the deaths. I don’t understand it.”

“Lily and Solon are the pixies?”

“There were more. Like a whole village. Solon was a hermit. Lily wanted to study magic with him. I guess she got her wish. But it seems wrong. It’s not like her to stand aside. She would not do that.”

Aurora stood there for a minute longer, her hands on her hips, surveying the gully. She grinned at Nick. “There was a little hidden cave here, like a small cabin. If I could find it, that would be a bit of solid evidence that I’m not suffering a breakdown.”

“You?” scoffed Nick. “Right now, I think you’re the only sane person. You seem to be taking this better than me, anyways.” He checked his watch. It was mid-afternoon. “You said you needed to be home.”

Aurora jumped and checked her own watch. She muttered something under her breath. “Let’s go, then.”

They found the trail and moved quickly. Soon, Nick was breathing heavily, trying to keep up with Aurora. Ten minutes later, they were walking past the remains of another burnt house. The fire fighters hadn’t been able to save that house, either. It was a blackened wreck. The fire trucks were still there, along with multiple police cars with their red and blue lights flashing.

Abruptly, Aurora turned into a front walk and approached one of the houses on the right side of the street.

“Is this your place?” asked Nick. The forest was right against their back fence.

“Yes. Want to come in? I need to check on my brothers.” She pulled a key out of her pocket and opened the front door. Nick followed her in.

“Jimmy! Seve! Are you home?” she yelled when she was inside. There were the sounds of galloping sock feet upstairs, and two boys came down the stairs two at a time.

“‘Rora! Where have you been?” asked the older of the boys. “Who’s this?” he asked, suddenly realizing that there was a stranger in his foyer.

“Working. This is Nick. He works for Mr. Beattie, too.”

“Who’s Mr. Beattie?” asked the younger boy. He had dark red hair like his sister.

Aurora sighed. “Don’t you listen? He was the man at the fire last night. The one with the funny suit. He gave me a job.”

“Oh.” The boy shrugged.

“Jimmy have you heard from Mom?” The older boy answered.

“Yeah, she called a few minutes ago.” The rambunctious energy that Jimmy had had a moment ago seemed to drain away. “She said that Dad isn’t doing good.” There was a painful silence. “But he’s still alive.”

“That’ll have to do. Did she say what we were supposed to do for supper?” Aurora led the two boys in the direction of the kitchen. Nick stayed in the front hall. He could hear Aurora talking to the boys. There were some sounds of cupboard doors opening and closing. Nick figured she might be a little while organizing the two of them.

*They were kidnapped?* he thought. He wanted to ask them about that, but it would have to wait. He pulled his phone out. He saw a few text messages had arrived. There was one from Ricardo, and one from Miss Patterson. He thumbed that one.

*We have got the first card,* the message said. Nick felt a stab of guilt. He hadn’t remembered to do the same. Then he realized that there was only one message. There should have been a second message, from when they’d gotten the second. Either Miss Patterson had forgotten to or…

Nick flipped to the map. His own dot was there, and Aurora’s icon as well, on top of the outline of one of the houses next to the forest.

Miss Patterson’s icon took a little longer to be placed on the map, but it was not at Mr. Beattie’s house. It was still in the forest.

“Aurora, something’s wrong,” Nick yelled.

“What?” Aurora yelled back. Nick followed the sound of the yell into the kitchen. There, he found Aurora directing her brothers to put a frozen pizza in the oven and toss a simple salad.

“I’ll be finished in a minute,” she said when she saw Nick. “You can go ahead to Mr. Beattie’s if you want.”

“No, Aurora, something’s wrong. Miss Patterson’s location is showing in the forest still.”

Aurora gave her brothers a quick glance, but they were fighting over how hot to set the oven. “Let me see.” Nick showed her his phone.

“She’s not too far,” Nick said.

“No, but unless you’re going to hop the fence, you gotta go the long way around,” said Aurora. Nick saw her make her mind up.

“Jimmy! Seve! Shut up for a second!” she yelled. The boys quieted. “Who can get their drone up and flying fastest?” The boys stared at their sister for a moment, as though they couldn’t believe their ears. Then they were racing each other for the stairs, shoving and pulling at each other. “Meet me out back!” she yelled after them.

Aurora led the way out the sliding glass door and into her back yard. There was an ornamental garden in the center of the lawn, arranged around the stump of a tree. There were other well-tended shrubs around the perimeter, and a tall, white-painted fence all the way around.

“This is where the oak tree used to be,” said Aurora as they waited. When Nick didn’t reply, she elaborated. “There was a rope swing. I was reading out here when Lily would visit me.”

Nick looked around at the fenced yard and the latched gates. “You didn’t wonder how a girl got in your yard?”

“Hey, I was eight. And yes, I did. It bugged me enough to go to my dad and we tried to figure it out.” She crossed her arms across her chest.

Approaching noise warned them that Jimmy and Seve were approaching. Each of them had what looked like a quadcopter drone in their hands and a pair of goggles on their head. Both boys were out of breath. The drones were much larger than he was expecting. They looked fast and mean.

“What’s the game, ’Rora?” asked Seve. He put his drone down and stood ready with the remote in his hands.

“No game, this is dead serious, Seve. There is a missing person. We need to find her as quick as possible. Nick, show them the map.” Nick did as he was told. Both of the boys nodded when they saw it and looked in the direction of the forest, as though judging the distance.

“You got it,” said Jimmy. He pulled the goggles down over his eyes. It was then that Nick saw that they were VR goggles, you couldn’t see through them.

“Hey, that’s cool,” Nick said. Seve had his own goggles on and both drones were spinning to life. “Are they fast?”

Jimmy grinned. “Buckle up, man. Time to turn and burn.” Both drones leaped into the air and in an amazing aerobatic maneuver, they flipped and streaked off in the direction of the forest, angling towards the north. In a moment, they were out of sight under the trees. The high-pitched sound of the copter blades faded.

It was less than ten seconds before Jimmy spoke.

“I see someone.” Beside him, Seve nodded. Their thumbs worked the sticks on their remote controls. “There’s a woman. She is crawling.” Jimmy was quiet for a second. “She looks like she’s in trouble. And the man with the funny clothes is there. He’s not moving.”

Nick flipped to the phone app and started dialling 9-1-1. Just as the call taker picked up, Seve spoke.

“What are those? They look like tiny people.”

## Chapter Eleven: Get Help

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Jimmy yelled. “They are looking at us! Seve! Evasive maneuvers! Scramble now!” Nick tried to filter out the noise as he spoke to the emergency call taker. He managed to get the important information across: there were two injured people in the woods about twenty meters off the property line. There were emergency crews on the site already, dealing with the house fire.

By the time the call was over, Jimmy and Seve had landed their drones in the back yard and they were pulling off their VR goggles.

“What was that, Aurora?” asked Seve with some excitement. Jimmy’s face was white and he was staring blankly at nothing.

“Thank you both,” said Aurora. “Nick, we need to get there. Get the memory cards from them.”

“‘Rora, you didn’t answer me,” complained Seve. “There was little people. Five of ‘em.” He moved and picked up his drone. He flipped it over and pulled out a memory card from the bottom. “I gotta see that again. Jimmy, you coming?” Jimmy didn’t answer, and his little brother stopped.

“Jimmy, what’s wrong?” he asked.

“It’s like a memory of a bad dream,” said Jimmy, still staring. His hand went to rub his forehead. It was shaking.

Aurora moved to him, and knelt, grabbing his hands in hers. She looked up at her brother with concern on her face. “Tell me what you remember, Jimmy.”

“Just flashes. There were little people. A cave. A whirlwind. I don’t remember much.” His eyes turned down to meet Aurora’s. “I think I remember there being a man. He… I trusted him. But…” He burst into tears. Aurora pulled him into a hug.

“Shh,” she whispered. Her eyes met Nick’s and there were tears in them as well. Aurora let her brother go and spoke to him with a voice full of earnestness. “Jimmy, I am remembering things, too. We’ll figure this out together, okay?” She sighed. “There’s so much happening right now. But I will be there for you. Do you understand me?”

Jimmy nodded, rubbing at his nose with a fist.

“Nick, let’s get a copy of everything. The drone footage, the sensor camera, and your phone video. We need to find out who we can get it to. We are finished trying to be heroes.”

“Heck, I signed up to find bugs,” said Nick. He smiled at Jimmy and put a hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Come on, let’s find a thumb drive and pull this stuff together. You too, Seve.”

Seve was left in charge of the pizza, and Nick and Jimmy went to the boy’s laptop, where they managed to copy all of the files onto a USB drive. Jimmy dropped the plastic drive into Nick’s hand. Nick bounced it a couple of times on his palm before closing his fingers on it.

“This is seriously messed up,” he said. Nick looked around Jimmy’s room. It looked like the normal, messy place a young boy would live. There were random bits of clothing on the floor along with sports gear: a baseball glove, and a lacrosse ball were in the corner. The posters on his wall were mostly moodily-lit pictures of what looked like racing drones. There was a signed poster of some teenager holding a drone and a trophy. The bed was not made. “I mean, the video, not your room.”

“What the hell is going on?” Jimmy asked.

“If I knew, I would tell you.” Nick stood, and looked out the window at the forest. “I think your sister knows more, but I think we’re all in shock right now. She told me some things that she remembered. Ten years ago. You would have been…”

“Five,” said Jimmy. “I—I know that Seve and I… went missing. We didn’t run away. Mom doesn’t mention it, but I know it. But it can’t have happened, because Aurora doesn’t talk about it. And she talks about *everything*.”

Nick turned. Jimmy was still sitting at his desk. “Jimmy, Aurora and I are going to try to get people to help. But you know all these fires?” The boy nodded. “They are all in houses next to the forest.” Jimmy looked at him with wide eyes. “I think the little people might be responsible. You need to be on guard. If you see or hear anything, you need to call 9-1-1 and then leave. Do you understand?”

“Where did Aurora go?” asked Jimmy. He looked scared.

“She went to make sure the ambulance people found those two hurt people in the forest. She will be back. Jimmy, do you understand me?” Jimmy looked at him and nodded solemnly.

“Good. If your sister comes back here looking for me, I’m going to be at Mr. Beattie’s house.”

“Why? Why are you leaving?” Jimmy’s voice was plaintive.

“Because I need to put these files in a safe place.”

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora watched as the ambulance took Mr. Beattie away. He was unconscious and the paramedics had immobilized his head before carrying him out of the woods on a stretcher. They had knocked down part of the fence to do so: going straight out the back of the property to rescue him and Miss Patterson. Miss Patterson had been dazed, but able to walk out of the woods and into the ambulance on her own.

She had seen Aurora standing at the edge of the crowd control barriers for the house fire and had given her a smile before coming over. She slipped two small memory cards into Aurora’s hand before being guided by the paramedics into the back of the ambulance. She didn’t have any words for Aurora, but her eyes were on the young woman until the back doors of the vehicle slammed shut and it pulled away, siren blaring.

Aurora had jumped at the sound of the siren. There had been too many of them on this street in the past weeks. It made her think of her dad and how he had been taken away. It had only been days, but it seemed like weeks ago.

She put her hands into the front pocket of her hoodie and was surprised to find a piece of paper there. She let go of the memory cards and pulled the paper out to look at it.

It was a small square of yellowish paper that was folded in half. The paper was thick and rough as though it was handmade. When she unfolded it, it was no bigger than a playing card. The handwriting on it was tiny. Aurora needed to put her eyes closer to it to read it.

*Rainbow Ravine. Nine o’clock tonight. L.*

Aurora flipped the paper over, but there was nothing else to be seen. Involuntarily, Aurora looked around. *How did this get there?* she thought, and then she remembered Lily giving her a hug before flying away. Her friend left her the note when she wasn’t permitted to speak openly. Aurora checked her watch. It was only five o’clock now. There was still a lot of time.

*Where is that police officer?* Aurora looked around the scene. There had been a non-uniformed policewoman at the last fire and she thought she’d seen her earlier. She had seemed like she was in charge of the investigation.

Aurora scanned all of the faces on and around the property as she moved along the police perimeter. She tucked the paper back into her pocket and felt the two squares of plastic that were the memory cards. She had made her way almost to the edge of the next property when she spotted the woman. She was as Aurora remembered: an older woman. Her hair was gathered back with more gray in it than brown. Her eyes were very tired-looking blue and she walked from place to place, speaking with different people with a slump to her shoulders. Aurora waited and watched her. She wanted to get the policewoman’s attention, but she didn’t really want to draw attention to herself. Aurora contented herself to watch her go about her business.

The woman spoke with several uniformed police officers, some who were coming back from being in the forest. None of those were looking too alarmed, so Aurora figured none of them had seen anything supernatural. There were the fire inspectors. They were in uniform, but it was a simpler white button-up shirt with black epaulets or a windbreaker marked with the fire department logo. They looked worn out. Aurora wasn’t surprised at that. She doubted Victoria would see this many fires in three years as they had in two weeks.

And if the fires were being set by faeries, they had no chance of making any sense of them. Even if they left some physical evidence behind, what would it look like? A footprint a half-centimeter long? Would an inspector even recognize it for what it was?

Aurora looked at the house. It was mostly intact, but the insides of the windows were blackened and streaks of black marred the white stucco. The front door was broken, and the front yard was a mess of churned mud from the spray and heavy boots. She thought that this was the Carson house, but she wasn’t sure. This house had sold a couple of years previously.

The police woman looked up from her work and knuckled her back. She was looking in Aurora’s direction, so the girl waved. That caught her attention. The woman looked around uncertainly for a moment before starting to walk over to where Aurora was waiting. She stepped over the fire hoses that were still running from the front of the property to the back. She smiled at Aurora in a motherly way when she came closer.

“Hello, did you want to speak to me?”

“I think so. Are you investigating the fires?”

“I am. That’s my job. My name is Constable Jeffries.” She tried to keep her public-relations smile in place, but Aurora could see her struggling.

“I work with Mr. Beattie,” Aurora said simply. She had guessed that this woman would know who that was, and from the facial reaction, she knew she was right. Immediately her face changed from police-speaking-to-school-kid to something more serious.

“You work with him?” she looked Aurora up and down.

“I’ll try not to be offended,” replied the girl. “I was hired to do some data processing and coding.”

Jeffries was looking at her and then in the direction that the ambulance had taken Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson. There was an unspoken question.

“Yes, they were hurt. They’ve been investigating and it… got a little dangerous. Do you have any time to speak to me?”

“I… do,” Constable Jeffries said with hesitation. She looked critically at Aurora again. “Are you saying you have evidence that will help with this case? With any of the cases?” Aurora imagined there was a slight tinge of desperation in her tone. *The investigation is not going well.* “I have to finish here. It’s going to be a late night. Again.”

“I’ll be down at Mr. Beattie’s house. Do you know which one that is?”

“Yes, it had the car crash into the wall yesterday.”

“Yep, that’s the one. Come around to the back, that’s where the office is,” Aurora said. As soon as she extended the invitation, Aurora felt anxiety. *I am going to have to convince this woman of something I barely believe myself.*

Jeffries checked her watch. “The inspector said he was going to be a while before he was ready to report. Let me make sure the investigators are organized. I’ll try to be there in about twenty minutes.”

Aurora left the scene walking but soon she was hustling and then she was running. She needed to be ready for this presentation, and she hadn’t even seen any of the footage or images yet.

*What was I thinking?* she asked as she pounded up the street to the gate to Mr. Beattie’s house.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick had just uploaded the drone footage to the file server when Aurora burst in, scaring him.

“What is it? What’s wrong?” he said, jumping up from his office chair.

“I’ve done something stupid,” Aurora gasped, her lungs working hard.

“What? What happened now?” Nick was looking out the office windows, seeing if anything was chasing her.

“I talked to the police. The lead investigator is going to be here in twenty minutes!” Aurora landed hard on a chair and flipped open her laptop.

“That’s it?” Nick asked slowly.

“Yes! Don’t you see? We have to have their help. And to do that we’re going to have to make a senior policewoman believe in faeries!” Aurora put her hands over her face. “What have I done? I should just call her. Or go back and tell her not to bother.”

Nick felt a sense of dread that he only felt just before he had to give oral presentations in school. His hands went clammy. But he knew something that Aurora didn’t.

“Hey,” he said, rolling his chair over to her. He went to put a hand on her shoulder, then hesitated. He decided it would be okay, and let his hand come to a rest. “It will be okay.”

“I just realized why Mr. Beattie was being so careful,” Aurora said, her voice muffled by her hands. “Down in my soul. I understood it here,” she pointed at her head. “But now I get it here,” she pointed at her chest.

“Let’s take it one step at a time,” said Nick. “How about you start with looking at the video? You gotta see the footage your brothers got.”

Aurora gave him a weak smile, and then fished two SD cards out of her hoodie’s front pocket. “Miss Patterson gave me these. They managed to get them.”

Nick watched over Aurora’s shoulder as she slid first one then the other card into her computer and pulled the folders of images off. Nick showed her where he’d put the rest of the files and she added Miss Patterson’s.

“Let’s see what we got,” she said. She launched the app that she had been working on and dragged in the images from the three sensors. Immediately a progress bar popped up, indicating that the program was rectifying the images and filtering them.

Aurora’s stomach growled. “I wish I’d had a slice of that pizza before I left,” she muttered.

“It wasn’t cooked yet,” said Nick. “But I spoke to Mr. Beattie’s valet. I let him know what had happened to Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson… are they going to be okay?”

“I don’t know.” Aurora shook her head. “She was okay and walking. Mr. Beattie was on a stretcher.” The progress bar finished and the main screen opened. Aurora looked around, and then unplugged her laptop and shifted over to the Smart board. She plugged in the video input, and her laptop screen was showing on the big wall display.

“We need to go through these,” she said. “You yell if you see anything that looks… I don’t know. Important. Okay?” Nick nodded. “This is from the first camera that Miss Patterson retrieved.”

The images were difficult to make out at first. The shadowed forest had strange blooms of heat from where the sun could make its way through the canopy, and the trees and shrubs were dark gray noise. Aurora flipped through a half-dozen pictures without either of them seeing anything.

“I probably could train the AI to ignore the sunlight spots,” she said. “Probably a breeze triggered the motion detector. There are a lot of pictures still to go through.”

She picked up the pace. The similarities among the photos, with the same field of view in every shot made it easier to look for differences. The spots of sunlight flickered in and out between pictures as the tree branches moved, but they also slowly crawled along the forest floor as the sun moved overhead.

“Stop!” Nick yelled. Aurora froze, about to hit a key to advance to the next image. “Go back one.” He got up and walked right up to the screen.

Aurora did as asked. “Now, the next one,” he said. Aurora complied. “And back. See here?” Nick pointed at the screen.

“What?” Aurora said. She was looking where Nick was pointing, and the squinting at her own screen.

“Here. That’s not a shadow. Go to the next image.” Aurora did. Nick scanned the next frame and then stabbed the screen with his finger. “There! See?” There was a small blob that had moved from the first frame to the second. It was a couple of meters off the forest floor, and not lost in any of the noise.

“Yeah, I see it,” said Aurora. She flipped to the next frame. “Now there’s three,” she said.

They found evidence in the next four frames as well, but that was all. Aurora magnified the images as much as she could, but they remained fuzzy blobs. They were about the right size and moving like they might be expected to, but that was nothing that would convince a skeptical audience.

There was a knock at the office’s outside door.

Aurora and Nick shared a look when they saw that Constable Jeffries was there and waiting.

“You know that feeling, like you have to give a presentation?” Nick asked. Aurora nodded. “And now you’re scrambling to write your slides before class because you forgot to do your homework. Isn’t that the best feeling?”

“Yeah, I got that in spades,” said Aurora. She got up and opened the door to let the policewoman in.

“Constable Jeffries, this is Nick Jackson. He’s a biology student at the University. We’re both working for Mr. Beattie.”

Nick remembered seeing this woman before at the scene of the accident out front.

“Good to see you again, Constable,” he said. She looked tired.

“We’re just going through some of the data,” said Aurora. Her voice betrayed some of her nervousness.

“What data?” Jeffries asked. They led her over to the Smart board. Aurora disconnected her laptop and the dark image from the sensor was replaced by the map they had been using, marked with the locations of the fires and the sensors.

Nick took the lead, explaining the work he had been hired to do by Mr. Beattie. He started at the beginning. He saw that Aurora was working at her laptop, so he figured he was buying her time. That gave him confidence and a sense of purpose.

“We didn’t really connect any of the research to the… the deaths until just yesterday,” he said after speaking for a while. The Constable was quiet. Nick thought he could see the wheels turning behind her eyes.

“We deployed the sensors this morning, at the locations you see here.” He indicated the blue circles.

“You had surveillance devices there?” she asked. “Did they pick up anything? Those ones are really close to all three fires today.”

Nick looked at Aurora, and the young woman nodded. Her eyes were bright.

“Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson were… injured when they were retrieving information from this sensor,” Nick pointed at the map. “They were accosted by the perpetrators. Before we show you any of the footage, I want to make something completely clear.” He paused, making sure that he had Jeffries’ full attention.

“We are deadly serious. We know there have been lives lost. We might be young, but we have been following the directives of our employers who now are among the victims. We ourselves were assaulted this afternoon when retrieving information from that camera.” He pointed at the blue circle at the top of the hill.”

“Aurora?” Nick asked, passing the presentation to her.

She cleared her throat as she plugged the Smart board into her laptop again. The first few words were uncertain and wavering, but her voice grew stronger as she spoke.

“The images are infrared,” she began. “It can take a bit to figure out what you’re looking at, so I added a color ramp. The images that had been black-and-white before were now false-color, with warm spots being red, orange and white and the cool being blue to black.

*She did that while I was talking?* Nick tried to hide his reaction, but he was sure he couldn’t keep the amazement off his face.

“These areas here are sunlight hitting the ground. I can adjust it further so that they don’t distract.” The sunlight spots disappeared from the view. There was now only a mix of black and blue on the image. “What we are looking for is changes between the images and warm spots.”

“I know how infrared cameras work,” said Jeffries. She didn’t say it unkindly, but it seemed to rattle Aurora a bit.

“Um, yes. So… here’s an image with something in it.” She pulled up the first one, where Nick had spotted one blob. It was a lot clearer now that it was in color.

Jeffries squinted at it. “That’s not a person. What’s that, a bird?”

“That’s the right scale,” said Nick, deflecting.

Aurora showed the next few frames, where there were three blobs moving in formation. She did not bother to explain what they suspected they were.

“And then there are a few more later on, returning.” She showed another set of five frames, with the same number of dots moving back the way they had come. “That was thirty minutes later.”

Constable Jeffries’ eyebrows were drawn down. Nick hoped that the other cameras had better images. But he knew what was coming, with the drone footage. He was willing to wait. As long as the policewoman was.

“The next camera showed something very similar.” She showed a few frames.

“No people? No one entering the area or leaving it?” Jeffries asked.

“No, no people,” said Aurora. The next sensor got the best pictures. Remember, we didn’t place these to identify an arsonist.” Jeffries shifted and looked at her watch.

The image shifted, again showing the vague outlines of a view of the forest in blue and black. Then the next image showed a colored blob. This one was much closer to the lens. It was still small and indistinct, but this was the first one that Nick could recognize as being *unnatural*. He had seen Solon and Lily. He had seen the drone footage.

The next frame was better. To Nick’s eyes, he could make out a humanlike figure, with torso, legs, arms and a head. He also could make out a blur of blue-green at the back of the figure. *Wings.* If he hadn’t been looking for them, he wouldn’t have noticed.

“What am I looking at?” asked Jeffries, leaning forward and squinting at the screen.

The next frame was clearer, and there there three more figures, smaller and farther away, but still clear enough that Nick was impressed. Maybe his plan to identify an invasive species of insect would have worked. *If that had ever been the point,* the thought with a pang of regret.

“What the hell?” Jeffries drifted off.

Nick jumped as a different voice came from the direction of the door to the rest of the house.

“Those turned out well,” said Miss Patterson. “Those are what did this to us?”

“Miss Patterson!” exclaimed Nick. “You’re okay!”

“Ellie, please Mr. Jackson, or should I say Nick? We’ve been through enough together to drop the formality, don’t you think?”

“Miss Patterson, you don’t look the worse for wear,” said Constable Jeffries. “Did you go to the hospital?”

“Yes, they released me right away after checking me out. I was more scarred mentally than physically. Mr. Beattie is still in intensive care. He should be okay, I think.” She smiled and brushed at her long, dark skirt. “They didn’t want me taking up a bed at the hospital. I took an Uber her as quick as I could. I wanted to see these.”

“Yes, about that. Those don’t look right. Are those people with jetpacks? They are *flying* thought the forest, for Chrissake.” No one answered her right away. “I mean, I’ve got a niece who loves watching cartoons, and you know what that looks like is Tinkerbell.” She said it as a joke, but no one laughed. “Oh, come on. You aren’t serious. Jesus, I gotta get back.”

Jeffries looked angry. Miss Patterson looked distraught. “You can see what you’re looking at. You said it yourself,” she said.

“Lady, I’ve been doing this a long time. Maybe this ain’t Florida with whackos in every apartment, but I’ve had my share in twenty years. But this is the first time I’ve ever had someone try to play a hoax on me. Don’t you know that there are people *dying* out there. I’ve got an arsonist who is escalating and the people are getting caught in the flames. Do you have any idea how horrible dying in a fire is? Roy explained it to me a couple of nights ago over a beer. The lucky ones are unconscious when their clothes ignite.”

The screen changed. The movement caught Jeffries’ eye, and she looked. Nick saw that Aurora had put up the video that he had shot on the hilltop. Solon and Lily were in the frame. She had her drab clothes on, but Solon was looking like a crazy, bearded castaway with tattoos all over his body. The audio wasn’t good, but he could hear Solon say “We’re leaving, girl.”

That was when Jeffries sucked in an involuntary breath. Right there, in high definition, Solon shrank, sprouted wings and flew rapidly out of the frame. The camera angle went screwy as he’d tried to track Solon’s flight, but there wasn’t anything viewable until it came back to Aurora and Lily.

Everyone watched in silence as Lily came to Aurora, gave her a hug, and then repeated the spectacle. This time, he’d done a better job of following the pixie’s flight and the video ended not long after the tiny figure disappeared into the shadows under the trees.

“That… that was well-done,” said Constable Jeffries. “I’ve seen better special effects, but…”

“Surely Constable…” said Miss Patterson, but Aurora interrupted.

“I’m not done,” she said. The screen changed again. This time there were two videos side-by-side. They were silent, showing a flying point of view. They were the recorded  footage from both Jimmy’s and Seve’s drones. One was slightly ahead of the other: Nick could see the first drone in the video from the second. The speed was impressive. This was the second time he’d seen the footage, but never side-by-side like this.

“What is this?” asked Miss Patterson. In a moment, she had her answer. The drones darted through the trees, until a figure came into view. It was Miss Patterson. She was dressed as she was now, crawling on the forest floor. Nick glanced at Ellie, and noted the grass stains on the front of her skirt. He saw Constable Jeffries do the same. Miss Patterson was having difficulty. Her head was down and she was waving at something invisible, trying to bat something away.

The drone views diverged and the second view showed Mr. Beattie. He was sprawled and not moving. His face was up, and blood smeared his forehead. The drones circled the scene.

Nick marvelled at the way the boys were controlling the drones. Aurora paused the footage and backed it up a few seconds. She moved her mouse pointed until it was over a corner of the video.

“Look,” was all she said.

Everyone looked. Nick smiled to himself. He knew this was only a taste of what was to come. One of the faeries was visible in the frame. He—Nick assumed it was a he—was dressed in drab clothes that blended in with the grasses and mulch that were on the forest floor, but he was there. Aurora let the video go ahead.

The drones were revolving around the scene, and Nick could see the faeries’ faces turning up to look at the drones instead of the human figures. One of the tiny figures signalled by pointing with an arm, and three figures turned and flew up towards the cameras. At that point, the views skewed wildly and then the drones were racing away at top speed, dodging trees and then bursting out into the sunlight. There he was: Nick was standing in Aurora’s back yard, with the boys wearing their goggles and working their remote controls, and Aurora looking up at the incoming drones.

Aurora rewound the video back to the point that the faeries had launched themselves at the drones. She slowed the playback to a crawl and then froze each video feed at the clearest, largest image of the incoming faeries. There still was a fair bit of motion blur, but Nick felt a sense of… peace. Until he’d seen the footage, he hadn’t trusted his own memories of the visual assault by the faeries in the forest and the intervention by Lily. Now he felt at peace because he had evidence. *I’m not crazy.*

“You know the timeframe here. This was only an hour ago,” said Nick. “Even ILM couldn’t turn this around that fast.”

“You told us what you thought the infrared picture looked like,” said Aurora. “What about now? What does that look like?”

Constable Jeffries sat down on the floor, hard.

It took some time for her to come around and say it aloud.

“It… it matches the evidence,” she said shakily. Ellie had gotten her a brandy in a crystal glass and she had drank it down. “We had so much opportunity for evidence: security cameras, soft earth, fences, locked doors. But not a sign of any entry.” She was silent for a while longer. “No friends or landlords coming forward telling us someone was acting strangely. No reports of any kind.”

“I was starting to think of the possibilities of some kind of airborne firestarter, you know,” she said. “It didn’t help at all with the drowned kids, unless they saw something and followed it, but I was grasping at straws. There just was no evidence that someone had entered any of the premises.” Constable Jeffries was dazed, sitting on the floor. “You realize that I now have to figure out how to use this.”

“What do you mean?” asked Nick.

“I mean, you do not walk into the briefing room and start talking about faeries. I’ll be out on the street without a pension faster than you can say ‘crazy’.”

“Mr. Beattie was faced with the same problem,” said Miss Patterson.

“Yeah, we figured that out,” said Nick. “Eventually,” he added when Aurora raised an eyebrow at him.

“How do I defend the community against… against…” she waved a hand at the frozen picture on the display.

“Mythical creatures?” suggested Aurora.

“That doesn’t help,” grumbled Jeffries. “Did Mr. Beattie share any plan with you?” she asked Miss Patterson. “Other than you were going to collect enough evidence to come forward with?”

“No, nothing more,” said Miss Patterson. “But then when he started planning a couple of months ago, it was more of a curiosity thing. Proving he wasn’t imagining things. This escalation that has happened in the time since wasn’t ever part of the planning.”

“Do you think this is because you started doing…” Jeffries waved a hand, “… whatever it was you were doing?”

“Do you mean, did we cause the escalation?” asked Miss Patterson, crossing her arms. “I can’t imagine how. We hadn’t done any serious work until Mr. Jackson started his survey. And that was after three arsons already.”

They debated for another twenty minutes. Constable Jeffries took a copy of the footage with her. The closest they came to a solution was using K-9 units to pick up the scent from the places in the drone video where they knew the faeries had been.

“Maybe that will work,” Jeffries said as she put the USB drive into her coat pocket and walked out the door. “I’ll also compare the information from the investigations with this. If I can find anything incontrovertible, who knows?”

When she had left, Nick, Aurora and Miss Patterson stood and looked at each other for a minute.

“Now we wait?” asked Nick.

“I… I’m not sure,” said Miss Patterson. She sat down carefully in one of the office chairs. “Everything has happened so fast. I need to get back to the hospital to check on Lawrence—Mr. Beattie,” she said. A faint flush appeared in her cheeks.

“Do we get the memory cards from the sensors tomorrow?” asked Aurora.

Miss Patterson frowned. “If we do, we’re doing it all together. *If* we do.” She shuddered. “I thought that going in pairs would be enough to keep us safe today. I was wrong.”

“I’m going to head home,” said Nick. “I’m dead tired and I still need to ride a ways.”

“Can I give you a ride?” asked Miss Patterson. “I’m heading to the hospital in a minute.”

“Nah, the fresh air will help,” said Nick. Aurora unplugged her laptop and in a couple of minutes, she was walking with Nick to the front of the house where his bike was locked up. He used the key and soon his bike was ready to roll.

“That’s a nice bike,” Aurora observed.

“Thanks,” said Nick, with a bit of pride. “I restored it myself. Had to fabricate a few impossible-to-find parts. Adapted a few modern bits where I had to.” The blue-and-silver steel frame needed a bit of a wash, but that was pretty normal for a bike in Victoria. It rained a lot.

“How did you fabricate parts?” she asked, eyeing the bike more closely.

“I know a guy,” said Nick. “My best friend when I was a kid ended up working at a vintage car place as a mechanic. They sometimes have to do the same thing with car parts. I borrowed the shop after hours.”

“That’s impressive,” she said. They began walking along the path to the front gate.

“Not nearly as impressive as what you put together there,” he jerked a thumb back at the house. “I think the Constable’s eyes were going to pop out of her head. Every time I thought that couldn’t get better, you hit her again with better stuff. By the end, it was just mean.”

“It was not,” Aurora protested, but Nick could see she was playing along. They went through the gate, with Aurora holding it open for Nick and his bike.

“I will see you tomorrow?” Nick asked as he strapped on his helmet.

Aurora shrugged. “I think I might go to school,” she said. “If you need me to go into the forest to get the memory cards you can text me.”

“Sounds like a good plan”, said Nick. “I wonder what’s going to happen? If this is in the hands of the police now, I don’t think they need an entomologist. I might need to find another summer job.” It was depressing to say it, but he hadn’t signed up to risk his life.

“I might work on the code at school tomorrow. There’s a lot to tweak. I bet I could refine the automatic classification algorithm to detect the faeries.” She giggled. “It still sounds stupid when I say it.”

“Yeah. If this doesn’t bust the scientific world wide open, I don’t know what will,” said Nick. “I mean, how do you even classify them in the grand tree of life? They have to fit somewhere.”

“If we get labelled as crackpots, we’ll have to enjoy our notoriety together,” said Aurora. She gave Nick a smile.

“Team Crackpot, that’s us.”

## Chapter Twelve: Understanding

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora watched Nick pedal off into the evening sun. His figure threw a long shadow across the road. Soon the sun would fall behind the trees of the forest, shadowing the street. She waited until he had turned the corner and was out of sight before she turned and walked the hundred meters or so to her house. She took the few moments of peace and used them to think about Nick. When she got back home, she would have a thousand things come crash down on her, but for the moment she could lose herself.

She snorted as the stray thought entered her brain that in some ways Nick was like her father. He was supportive, but it wasn’t in the same way. They’d worked as a team today, and just fit together. She hoped that today’s events wouldn’t end Mr. Beattie’s investment in them. She could see herself enjoying working with Nick for the summer. She caught herself running a hand through her hair and forced herself to stop.

*For all I know, he’s got a girlfriend. Heck, for all I know he’s gay.* That evoked a sigh.

She was walking up the front path to her door, when she became aware of a sound. It was a high-pitched alarm going off. It was the sound of a smoke detector, and it was coming from her house. Aurora was instantly in motion, unlocking the front door and throwing it open.

Inside, there was a smell of smoke, but it wasn’t thick. The sound of the smoke alarm was ear-piercing.

“Jimmy! Seve!” Aurora yelled as she ran into the house. She looked up the stairs towards the bedrooms, but didn’t see or hear anything up there. The smoke seemed thickest ahead, towards the kitchen.

Aurora almost ran into Jimmy as she came to a skidding halt on the linoleum of the kitchen floor. Her brother was holding a cooking pot with a lid partly covering it. The smoke was coming from inside the pot.

“What…?” asked Aurora, her breath and pulse racing.

“I burned the popcorn,” said Jimmy, loud enough to be heard over the smoke alarm. He looked sheepish.

“Take it outside!” yelled Aurora, a rush of anger replacing the panic. She retraced her steps out to the hall and then climbed the stairs. The smoke alarm was in the hall outside the bedroom doors. Seve was there with a towel, flapping at the alarm. The beeping stopped and Seve let his arms down, still staring at the alarm, daring it to start again.

“Oh, hi ‘Rora,” said Seve when he saw his sister. “I’m not tall enough to push the button.”

“Jesus Christ, you guys scared me,” she said.

“Aurora!” Seve said, scandalized at her language.

“There’s been five arsons on our street and you guys made me think our house was on fire,” she said.

“Sorry, ‘Rora,” said Seve. “We didn’t know we was going to burn the popcorn.” His eyes were a little red and shiny, like he might start crying. Instantly, Aurora felt chagrin at yelling at them both.

“Hey, it’s alright,” she said, and she gave Seve a hug. “I’m just happy it’s nothing to worry about.” Seve returned the hug with interest.

They went downstairs, and helped Jimmy clean the burned remains of their snack out of the pot. They opened doors and windows until the smell of smoke was gone.

Aurora was just closing the front door, when Mom drove up in the car. She opened it again, and watched and waited as her mom pulled into the driveway and turned off the car. She was slow to open the door, sitting for a short while, staring at the steering wheel.

All of Aurora’s good feelings fled. So much was happening that had distracted her from the reality of Dad being in the ICU. To have it all be torn away with a sudden dose of reality left a cold hole where her stomach should have been. Fear stopped her from going to meet her Mom at the car. Her feet wouldn’t work.

*Is this it? Is this where I find out?* she asked herself. *Did Dad die this evening and I just don’t know it yet?*

Eventually, Mom did get out of the car. She looked tired. Her skin was an unhealthy color and her eyes were two shadows. She moved slowly, but when she saw Aurora watching her, she gave a guarded smile. Aurora’s hopes leaped.

Mom stopped in front of her daughter, and opened her arms for a hug. Aurora paused a moment, scanning her Mom’s face for any more clues, before closing and wrapping her arms around her mother.

“He’s still with us,” whispered Mom. Aurora started crying when she heard that. Then her mom started crying too. They were interrupted on the porch by the sound of Jimmy’s voice.

“What… what are you doing?” he asked. There was fear in his voice.

Mom freed herself and gave Jimmy a watery smile. She invited him for a hug and he accepted. “Dad’s still in the hospital,” Mom said. “I felt—I needed to see you all. I have spent so much time at the hospital. I was going crazy.” She let Jimmy go, and Seve had showed up. He got a hug, too. Mom wiped her eyes and blew her nose on a tissue she pulled from her purse.

She led the way into the house. “Why do I smell burnt oil?” she asked.

“Popcorn,” said Seve. “Jimmy burned some.”

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora slipped out of the house without the boys noticing. Mom had gone back to the hospital to continue her vigil. It was quarter to nine at night and the sun was already hiding behind the forest. It would be light for an hour yet. *Light enough, anyways.* Her brothers were busy beating each other up playing *Gang Beasts* on the XBox, laughing their heads off. They wouldn’t notice she was gone for a short while.

She fingered the folded piece of paper in her hoodie pocket as she walked along her street. She felt a drip of cold sweat trickle down her spine. Her stomach was in knots. Walking past three different burnt-out houses on her way did nothing to help her sense of calm. It was less than a ten-minute walk to Rainbow Ravine once she entered the woods. Lily would be there. Aurora had to imagine that her friend would help keep her safe.

Nevertheless, it took her a moment to summon the courage to leave the pavement and put her foot onto the dirt trail. The shadows under the trees were darker than she had imagined they would be. She strained her ears, holding her breath, trying to hear anything from the forest before she entered it. There was nothing, only the faint rustling of the leaves in the canopy. With a deep breath, she plunged forward. *This is worth it.*

She moved quickly, and as quietly as she could. If nothing noticed her, then nothing would threaten her. Miss Patterson’s admonition that they would only enter the forest together or not at all made her feel guilt on top of the nervousness. *This is different,* Aurora told herself. *This is life and death.*

Mom had told her, when they were alone, that Dad’s oxygen saturation was dropping. The ventilator was barely getting him enough oxygen. She had said that the nurses would try to let her know when the end was near, but there was no guarantee that the rest of the family would be able to gather if the end came. Mom had packed a bag this time, intending to stay at the hospital. More than anything else, that let Aurora know that Dad was likely not going to leave the hospital.

When Mom had left, Aurora had found herself sitting on the couch, rubbing her ankle. Earlier that afternoon, she had twisted it and been unable to walk. A moment of Lily’s magic later, and she had been fine. Now there was barely any soreness at all. There had to be some way to get Lily to help her father. And Aurora knew where the pixie girl would be and at what time. The only problem was that it was in the forest.

Aurora barely dared to breathe as she walked along the trail through the woods. Her hoodie was grey, and her pants were brown. She shouldn’t draw any attention, but to a faerie, any human walking through the forest was like a giant rubbery monster attacking Tokyo from their perspective. She tried to keep her step light and avoid brushing against any shrubs. At one point, a squirrel ran through the underbrush, rustling the dead leaves and scaring the heck out of the girl. Her heart was racing as she leaned back against the bole of a Douglas Fir, trying to bring her breathing back to normal.

It wasn’t as easy as she imagined, but eventually Aurora located the point where she needed to leave the trail and cut uphill. The trickling stream flowing from Rainbow Ravine was almost unnoticeable where it crossed the path, under a short length of wooden trellis bridge. She cringed at the noise she was making, now that she was no longer on packed earth. But it was only a short climb before the familiar gully opened up.

There was no sign of life. No lights, no movement other than the water in the bottom of the ravine. Aurora checked her watch. It was eight fifty-six: she had timed her arrival well. There was nothing else to do, except wait. She crouched down and leaned against a tree, making herself as small and unnoticeable as possible. There was a peaceful air here, but she couldn’t help but imagine that every single noise was going to be accompanied by the thrum of faerie wings and high-pitched laughter.

Minutes passed. When the second hand on her watch swept past twelve, Aurora looked around hopefully. But Lily did not show up. At five past nine, Aurora fished out the paper and read it again in the failing light. It was getting quite dark under the trees. If Lily didn’t show up soon, she would have to leave. She didn’t fancy stumbling in the dark and really didn’t like the idea of waving around the flashlight on her phone in the forest. That would bring unwelcome eyes.

She was just about to give up, when she heard the vibrating *thrum* of wings. Aurora’s breath caught, and she looked about wildly. Before she could spot anything flying, Lily Merriweather was standing in front of Aurora, full human size, holding out a hand to help her up. Aurora took the offered hand and brushed herself off when she was standing.

“I didn’t think you were coming,” Aurora said.

“It was harder to sneak away than I thought,” said Lily. “I had to wait.”

“Wait? Sneak out? What, you’re not a girl anymore.” With a bit of guilt, Aurora remembered that she hadn’t told her brothers she was leaving.

“Solon wouldn’t like me doing this,” said Lily, looking around. Her dark eyes glinted reflected light in the dusk. “In fact, being this big and exposed is a really, really bad idea.” She turned back to Aurora. “Come on, just a bit farther.”

Lily led the way up the ravine a little ways, until the sides had closed in. It was noticeably cooler here. She stopped and turned to face Aurora.

“Do you still trust me?” she asked. “Remember, if you don’t trust me, this won’t work.” That triggered a memory in Aurora’s brain. Humans subconciously resisted direct action of the pixie magic. It was an automatic defense.

“Yes,” said Aurora. She had barely got the word out when the world spun around her. One disorienting second later, she realized that she was small. The moss she had been standing on a moment before was now a springy mass that was up to her knees.

Lily was there, the same natural size for her. She beamed. “I remember when that was super-hard to do. I haven’t tried that in ten years. Come on.” Lily’s wings, shimmering faintly in the dim light, had nothing to do, as Lily clambered up the rough, rocky, mossy terrain. Aurora followed, but they didn’t have far to go.

Lily disappeared behind a curtain of green, and when Aurora followed, she found herself in a pixie-sized room. Lily shut the door behind her and in a moment, the odd greenish light leaped up in lanterns around the space. There were comfortable chairs, some cots and what probably would be a pantry and other stacked up supplies in the corners.

“I remember being here,” she breathed as she took it in.

“That’s right. I remember that,” said Lily. “Such a long time ago. We’ll be undisturbed here.” There was a brief silence, then she spoke again. “I just wanted to apologize for today. Solon didn’t want us to interfere.”

“You did the right thing. You helped us,” said Aurora. She gave Lily a hug. It was a bit awkward: when Aurora tried to put her arms around Lily, her wings got in the way. They had a laugh.

“Yeah, but Solon is as mad as hell,” said Lily, releasing the other girl from the hug. “We spent all afternoon reinforcing the charms around the home. That’s why it was hard to sneak out. Getting in or out of our home is practically impossible, even if you know all the charms.” Lily’s face was sad.

“Lily, what’s wrong?” asked Aurora. “Why are the faeries attacking the people who live along the forest? Is Dereg at it again?”

“It’s a long story,” Lily said. “Things have changed. A lot.”

“Is your father okay?” Aurora asked. Brae had been helpful and helped fight back when the faeries had tried to sacrifice Aurora and her brothers.

“I hope so.”

“Wait, what do you mean, ‘you hope so’?”

“I haven’t seen them in two years now. They left. All of the People left, except for Solon and I.”

Aurora blinked. “They’re gone? Why?”

“It’s been a long ten years, Aurora,” sighed Lily. “Most of the faeries are gone, too. There’s just a stubborn group that decided to fight back. Yes, that includes Dereg, but he was released from prison years ago.” Lily looked at Aurora, and she could see her confusion in the pixie’s eyes.

“The People get their strength from the forest,” explained Lily, “and the forest is not healthy. There was a rot that attacked some of the oaks, at the roots. And there was a big windstorm six years ago. And then there are the subdivisions on the far side. Big chunks of the forest are gone now. Even the oak in your back yard is gone.” There was an anger in Lily’s voice as she spoke.

“The oak got the rot,” said Aurora. “It wasn’t safe.”

“You didn’t plant a new one, either,” said Lily.

“No,” admitted Aurora.

“There wasn’t enough forest for all the People and the faeries to live any more. It was dangerous, but they made it up island: the relocated. My brother Dryw came back to try to get me to come, too. That was two years ago.”

“They’re gone? Aren’t you lonely? Why are you still here?”

Lily snorted. It was a cute thing. There was one thing that the pixie girl was good at, and that was making everything seem cute. “Solon wouldn’t leave. Refused to leave Lunid’s grave behind. And I’m still his apprentice. I’m here until either he leaves, he dies or I’m no longer an apprentice. I tell you, that thing I did last night almost pushed Solon over the edge. I thought he was going to expel me from the forest.”

“So you managed to become his student after all?” Aurora asked. “You wanted to. How much have you learned.”

Lily’s eyes flashed darkly. “A lot.” She smiled, and it was all teeth.

“Couldn’t you help? With the faeries, I mean? They seemed scared of you this afternoon. They flew away as soon as you were there.”

“That was only four of them. And none of them were particularly strong. Solon and I could have beaten them in a stand-up fight. But they fled, and told the rest. There’s a dozen of them, including Dereg. Solon and I wouldn’t stand a chance.” She gave Aurora a sad look. “I’m not sure I would, even so. I can’t say that Dereg is wrong.”

Aurora was aghast. Her mouth dropped open. “Lily, people are dying.”

“He’s defending his home,” Lily shrugged. “I can’t say that how he’s doing it is right, but I have to respect that he’s doing it. Not everyone is made to run away.”

“Lily!” said Aurora.

“Hey, I’m only reporting the facts. Half of the trees are gone. There wasn’t enough spirit for the People to live. It wasn’t an easy thing to do. Everybody remembered how hard the journey was from Cornwall. We’d made a Home here. And we had to leave. The People weren’t going to fight, but Dereg came to the People and made his case. In the end, only a dozen faeries opted to stay. I hear the rest left and crossed the water to Washington State. With the borders closed from the pandemic, they couldn’t join their families even if they wanted to. It was either stay and fight, or die.”

“And you?” Aurora couldn’t keep the anger from her voice.

“Solon was staying. I had to stay, too. I will leave someday and join my family.”

“So you’re not taking part in setting houses on fire? How about drowning children?”

Lily’s eyes flared in anger. “I said the People aren’t fighting. We are staying out of their way, that’s all.”

“That’s sick. You know what they’re doing,” said Aurora.

“Look, all I wanted to do was apologize for earlier. I’ve done that. You can leave now,” said Lily bitterly.

“Are you going to apologize to the families of the dead? Or do I get a special pass because I helped the People out ten years ago?”

“Look,” said Lily. Her cheeks were flushed. Aurora wondered if she had pushed too hard. “I can’t do anything. The only reason Solon and I are left in peace by the faeries is we keep out of their way. If we started interfering, we’d be dead or forced to leave. And Solon wouldn’t leave.”

“Come on, you could do better,” said Aurora.

“I’m flattered,” said Lily. “But taking on a dozen is beyond Solon and I working together, and there’s no way he would do it. He’s only gotten more sour since Lunid died. He hasn’t forgotten that it was due to the humans.”

“That’s not fair! It was Dereg who caused it all,” protested Aurora.

“Depends on your point of view. He did it to try to be able to shift the balance of power. If he’d succeeded, the People would still be here. We wouldn’t have been forced out.”

“You sound like you approve of what he’s doing.”

“In principle, if not in method.”

There was an angry silence. Lily met Aurora’s stare. She didn’t look away with shame. Aurora thought she would have in her place.

“I came here for help,” Aurora said, breaking the silence.

“I told you…” Lily began, but Aurora interrupted her.

“Not about the faeries. I’ve given evidence to the police. It’s their problem now. It’s about my father.”

“You… you gave evidence? What evidence?” Lily sounded shaken.

“High-quality footage of four faeries torturing Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson. High-def. Good stuff.”

Lily’s face was white.

“Oh, and video of you and Solon,” Aurora added.

“We’re not supposed to be seen,” Lily said weakly.

“Bitch, please.” Aurora had never expected to be able to use that phrase. “In this day and age, everyone has an HD camera in their pocket. It was a matter of time. Too bad the first evidence was of your friends committing a crime.”

“They’re not my friends,” Lily protested, but her heart wasn’t in it. She stared at the door. “They will come and they will exterminate us. Or try. It’s like Cornwall all over again.”

“Then how about you do something good to try to balance things out? I said I came here for help.” Lily looked at her. “You can heal people. You fixed my ankle this morning.”

“I… Solon has taught me some,” said Lily.

“My father, he is in the hospital with COVID. In the ICU. They don’t expect him to make it.”

Lily’s face went soft with commiseration. “Oh, Aurora. I’m so sorry. But I can’t do anything.”

“Can’t, or won’t?” asked Aurora. *I’m not too sure about your morals right now,* she thought.

“Can’t. I mean, if he was here, I could help him. I couldn’t cure him, but I definitely could help.” She gestured at the room they were in. Aurora looked around but didn’t see anything special that would help.

“Because you can’t go to the hospital?” she asked. “You came to my room a long time ago. I know you can hide. I could get you in and out, I bet.”

Lily shook her head. “No, no. It’s not that. It’s the forest,” Lily said. Aurora frowned, trying to understand. “I told you, the People get their strength from the forest. It’s not a metaphor, we *actually* get our strength from the forest. If we leave and go to the lands of concrete, we will weaken. We lose our abilities. When the subdivision cut into the forest and the storm knocked down so many trees, there wasn’t enough left for the People and the faeries to stay.”

“You go to the hospital…” Aurora began.

“And I’ll be a semi-conscious tiny person with no magic,” said Lily. “Why do you think Dereg is only attacking the houses on the perimeter of the forest? Why do you think they have been planting saplings in the yards?”

“Planting saplings?” Aurora shook her head.

“They are. It’s part of the plan. Heck, the only reason I could cast the charm to shrink you in your room that night was because you had a tree in your back yard. The branches almost reached your window.”

Aurora digested that. She didn’t understand the connection between the pixies and the forest, but Lily seemed sure.

“That’s why it was such an ordeal to get here. Or to leave again. It’s not easy and we’re practically defenceless when doing it. I’m sorry Aurora. Unless you can move him here, I can’t help.”

Aurora felt a crushing disappointment. There was nothing for her to do. Moving her dad would probably kill him. There was only human medicine to try to save him. She didn’t realize how much hope she was putting on getting Lily to help until it was gone.

Lily’s arm was around Aurora as she cried, curled in on herself.

Lily took Aurora to her own back yard, first casting the lightness charm and then flying her. The cool night air brought Aurora back to herself and she was done crying before they landed. Lily got Aurora to stand right against the inside of the back fence before she reversed the shrinking charm, returning Aurora back to her normal size. Lily did not bother growing to say good-bye. She waved and took off, returning to the forest.

“Be careful, Lily,” Aurora whispered after the disappearing pixie. “Remember what’s right and what’s wrong.”

Inside, the boys were still playing their video game until Aurora chastised them for staying up on a school night and shooed them off to bed.

Aurora lay in bed, staring at the dark ceiling of her room until late in the night.

## Chapter Thirteen: Plans Change

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Lawrence put his head back onto his hospital pillows and let out a long breath. It had been a long time of questioning his own sanity. Maybe it hadn’t turned out exactly as he’d planned, but in the end his own sense of well-being was the most important thing.

“That… that is extraordinary, Miss Patterson. Who would have guessed that the decision to bring on Mr. Jackson and Miss Johnstone would pay such dividends?” Miss Patterson nodded, and put the iPad away. She had just finished showing him the same footage that they had shown to the police. *Extraordinary* was the word.

To go from no evidence of the existence of little people in the forest to high-definition video in one day seemed beyond possible.

“It was Miss Johnstone’s younger brothers who took the drone video,” Miss Johnstone said.

“Yes, I recall you said that before,” said Lawrence. He stared at the ceiling of his room, with its false ceiling and industrial fluorescent lighting. “And that the police have this in their possession.”

“It remains to be seen what will come of that,” said Miss Patterson, returning to the bedside chair in his hospital room. “I would say that Constable Jeffries’ reaction to the video was… problematic, but not unpredictable. I don’t imagine that her first move will be to put out an all-points bulletin for people three inches tall with wings.”

“Yes, I wonder what will come of that. She is now facing exactly what I was: knowing that something unbelievable is true. But she has proof.”

“She mentioned dogs. Using dogs to trace the scent. You don’t need to tell them they are looking for faeries,” said Miss Patterson. Lawrence looked, and there was a trace of a smile on her lips.

“I tried the same thing with university students. In the end it turned out you need to tell them.” He thought for a moment. “The first video, the one with the young woman and the old man. I think she was the one that I saw, all those years ago.” He smiled at the remembrance.

It had been a singular experience. Coming across such a creature in the forest, when hiking through. Lawrence had been lost in his own thoughts, dwelling on one of the clients’ projects he was working on, when he had seen an impossible sight: a tiny person with wings flying across a clearing, wings shining in the sunlight. She had alighted on a branch, seemingly resting. Lawrence had frozen, not wanting to startle the creature. Then she had launched into the air again, disappearing in the maze of trees in moments.

It wasn’t often that ten seconds can change a person’s life. He had immediately dived into the literature, trying to determine what he had seen. There were so many references to the work of J.M. Barrie that he started to wonder if perhaps the author and he had shared some kind of experience. He had bought his house to be close to the forest and try to repeat the encounter but never had. His obsession had extended to his lifestyle, aping the style, if not the inconvenience and questionable medicine of Barrie’s Victorian era.

And now he had video. It seemed incredible.

“I wonder if the police will be successful,” he mused.

“I suppose the dogs will be able to find the scent,” said Miss Patterson.

“But they fly. I don’t think a dog can track the wind.”

“Perhaps the dogs would find their nest, or home, or whatever they live in,” she said. It seemed reasonable.

Lawrence suddenly felt irritated with his confinement. He tugged at his blanket. “Where is that doctor? He said he would be back here to discharge me.”

Aurora was strangely uneasy. She was in her History class, after lunch. She had done as she had said to Nick: she had gone to school today. Exams started next week, and some of her classmates were panicking about it. The others were resigned to whatever their brains had retained. Aurora was not worried. She had brought her laptop to school and during the review sessions, she had flipped it open and worked at bits and pieces of her code, but her heart wasn’t really in it. The teachers had come by to see what she was doing, but when they saw the alphabet soup of code on her screen they would ask a few polite questions and then continue helping the other students.

Aurora knew that they had done everything they could and everything was in the hands of others. Whether it was the doctors and her father or the police and the faeries, others were now in charge. But that didn’t calm her mind at all.

Part of her worried about her house. Now that she knew exactly what was happening and why the houses adjacent to the forest were being targeted, it seemed likely that her house could be a target at any time. Before coming to school, she had made sure to stuff a few special items into her bag: things that she couldn’t bear to lose if the house burned down. She had disconnected the backup drive from the family iMac. It had the backup of all the family pictures on it. She had also packed some clean underwear and her toothbrush. It seemed a bit silly, but it wouldn’t seem that way if the worst happened. Aurora had considered staying home, but what good would that have done? She had no way to defend the house if the faeries did try to burn it. As it was, it was empty. If it burned, no one would get hurt.

She was also worried for Constable Jeffries. *She wouldn’t go alone into the forest, would she?* Aurora had to trust that she would take the danger seriously. Having a gun wouldn’t help if the faeries tricked her eyes. Besides, they’d be darn hard to hit with a bullet. *Not a big target.*

Aurora giggled nervously. Her closest classmates looked at her askance, but Aurora didn’t care. She was worried about too much to spare time for them.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Nick was bored. He’d showed up for work, pushed his bike around the back of Mr. Beattie’s house and found no one. He’d texted Miss Patterson, and learned that Mr. Beattie was still in the hospital. He was supposed to be released today, but they weren’t sure when.

Nick had let himself in with the office key, and settled in to wait. He really didn’t have anything to do. His original job, to locate invasive insect species, had been a sham. The follow up task of setting up and maintaining the network of sensors in the forest was on hold. He wasn’t allowed to go into the forest to retrieve the memory cards and replace the batteries. Even if he had been allowed and made it back out, the software for viewing the images was still on Aurora’s laptop. She hadn’t copied it to any of the office computers yet.

“So much for that,” Nick said to the empty office. “You just had to question why they were letting you lead the research project.” He took some time in the morning going through the Co-op Education website, looking for any other positions that he could apply to. Unfortunately, they were now well into the semester. All of the prospective employers had registered their open positions a month or two previously. There were a few positions available, but they were in remote corners of the province and not a good match for him. The local employment ads weren’t much better. *I guess it’s going to be another minimum-wage summer,* he thought. *It’s only a matter of time before they lay me off.*

He amused himself as much as possible. Noon passed with no sign of Mr. Beattie or Miss Patterson, and the afternoon passed. When it was after three, Nick left the office and walked to the street and walked along it until he was in front of Aurora’s house. He checked his watch again. He didn’t know exactly what time high school let out, but he figured that she ought to be home soon. So far today, Nick hadn’t heard any sirens on the street. That had to be a sign, but of what he wasn’t sure.

Nick was about to walk up to the house and ring the bell just in case she was home already, when he spotted Aurora coming around the corner in the distance. She was unmistakeable with her cloud of dark red hair. She was wearing her usual gray hoodie and black pants today. He waited and watched her approaching. She had noticed him waiting soon after she turned the corner, and Nick saw a flash of a smile.

When she was close enough, she called out. “What are you doing here? There’s laws against loitering, you know.”

“Waiting for you,” he said. “A slow day at the office.” Her face was always pale, but it looked *extra* pale. There were shadows around her eyes. She had so many things that she was worrying about. “Hey, TGIF, right?” he said with a smile. She returned the smile, but it was weak.

“How is your dad today?” Nick asked.

“Haven’t heard much today,” she said. “Got a text from Mom at lunch, was all.” She gestured towards her house. “Want to come in? The boys will be home any minute. I was thinking about making some lemonade for them. Want some?”

“Sure,” said Nick, following Aurora to the front door and through it when invited.

“Leave your shoes on. I figure we can sit on the back porch,” said Aurora as she put her book bag on the stairs and continued to the kitchen. Nick followed, and Aurora opened the freezer and dug for a bit before finding the frozen cylinder of lemonade concentrate. “You want to pass me that pitcher?” she asked, pointing to a glass one sitting on top of the cupboards. Nick complied.

“As you wish,” he said with a smile.

Aurora shot him a look, and smiled. “Thanks, farmboy.” She considered him for a moment. “You’d need to have some of your hair out of your ponytail and falling in front of your eyes to make a proper Wesley. You’re too put-together.”

“More of a Dread Pirate Roberts?” he asked, grinning.

“Hardly.” Aurora ran the frozen container under the tap for a bit and then opened it and slid the frozen contents into the pitcher.

Nick reached behind his head and tugged on the elastic that was keeping his hair back. It came free, and his curly black hair immediately rebelled against gravity.

“Oh wow,” said Aurora, looking appreciatively at it. Nick patted at it, knowing that it was a sight. Aurora came around the counter island, and looked up at his hair. “That’s pretty wild.”

“You’re one to talk,” he said, looking pointedly at her own hair.

She ignored the comment, and seemingly of its own volition, her left hand reached up and ran through his hair on the side of his head. Nick was surprised that she did it. It was an electric feeling, seeming to set fire to his nerves.

Aurora’s brown eyes went wide as though she just realized what she’d done. Her cheeks flushed and she jerked her hand back, but not before tangling a bit, jerking Nick’s head forward. He was pulled off balance, and found himself face to face with Aurora. He froze for a moment, very close to her.

Then there was the sound of the front door banging open, and boy’s voices in the front hall.

“’Rora?” called Seve. Nick pulled back and Aurora turned away and proceeded to pour water into the pitcher.

“In the kitchen,” she called. She had her head down, and her hair curtained her face, showing nothing.

Nick didn’t know what to say. That had been a completely unexpectedly intimate moment. He pulled his hair back again and corralled it into the elastic. It was in place when Jimmy came into the kitchen, followed by his brother.

“Hey, Nick,” he said. “Whatcha doin’, ’Rora?”

“Lemonade,” she said.

“Cool!” said Seve.

“Get some glasses if you want some,” she said. Soon they were all sitting out on the back porch enjoying the sunshine and sipping lemonade with ice.

“What happened with the drone video?” asked Jimmy.

“Yeah,” seconded Seve. “And is anybody going to ‘splain to me what that was about yesterday? I nearly got beat up at school today when I was talkin’ about it. Some boys called me a girl because I was playing with fairies.”

“Seve, you dumbass,” said Jimmy. “You gotta keep your mouth shut sometimes.”

“Jimmy, language,” said Aurora. “I’m sorry people were mean to you today, Seve, but…”

Aurora didn’t finish her sentence. She had her hand shadowing her eyes and she was looking at something. Nick followed her gaze.

Just at the top of the back fence, there was motion. He barely caught it before it disappeared. For a fraction of a second, he could have sworn he saw a tiny head.

“Boys, get inside!” hissed Aurora. “Jimmy, I want you and Seve to each grab a fire extinguisher.”

“What? Where are they?” said Jimmy. He seemed like he was going to argue for a moment, but to his credit, he grasped what was happening. Seve was just looking confused. Jimmy was looking in the direction that Aurora was searching.

“There’s a small one in the kitchen. It’s white. And the bigger red one in the upstairs hall closet. Get them, now.” The boys were moving towards the kitchen door when there was an explosion of motion and noise.

A shiny streak came out of the tops of the nearest oak tree, diving at the back fence. There was a whirring of wings that reminded Nick of an angry hummingbird, somehow. Four small figures burst into the air from the fence line, scattering from the oncoming tiny silvery shape.

Cracks of noise filled the air. Soon, all five winged figures were doing aerial maneuvers as small flashes of light and puffs of smoke burst in the air. It was a tiny dogfight, happening right above Aurora’s back fence. Four of the figures were drab and harder to spot, and one was shiny.

In moments, one of the drab shapes cartwheeled through the air from a bang that was too close. It barely regained control before hitting the ground, then unsteadily wound its way up and over the fence and then was lost from sight.

“What is going on?” Nick said to Aurora. He moved in front of her, offering some protection.

Aurora didn’t reply. The aerial combat continued. One more drab shape —*a faerie*, Nick thought— fell from the sky but then the shiny shape’s trajectory changed from a tight turn into a ballistic path. Nick watched as the shape fell and crashed into a hydrangea bush along the fence. The two remaining faeries swooped down towards the fallen shape, but then there was a much louder whirring sound.

Nick flinched as the shiny shape of a quadcopter drone shot by his ear. The drone screamed towards the remaining pair of fairies at full speed. They scattered, and the drone was in full pursuit. It performed mind-bending aerobatics, threatening to hit the faeries and knock them from the sky. In moments, it was over, with the faeries being chased into the woods by the drone.

Nick and Aurora turned, and Jimmy was there, his VR goggles on and the radio control in his hands.

“Nice work, little man,” said Nick. The sound of the drone was returning. Soon, it landed on the patio and Jimmy pulled off the goggles. “That was amazing.” Jimmy grinned, full of himself.

Aurora ran to the hydrangea bush, and everyone else followed a moment later. Aurora knelt and Nick looked over her shoulder at what was there.

It was the tiny figure of a pixie girl. It was Lily, and she wasn’t moving.

Carefully, Aurora scooped Lily’s tiny body up in her hands and carried her inside.

“Who is that?” asked Seve as Nick and the boys followed Aurora inside. No one answered him.

“Jimmy, get me a thimble from Mom’s sewing stuff.” She had to describe what a thimble was, but soon, Jimmy was back with a tiny silver thimble. Aurora laid Lily on a tea towel on the counter island and then took the thimble and filled it with water.

Nick watched with disbelief as she lifted the pixie’s head with one finger and put the thimble to her lips to sip. Soon there was motion. Lily’s head shifted, and then her arms and legs jerked as her eyes flipped open.

Somehow seeing her small like this, so close and in the human environs of the kitchen brought it home just how *alien* she was. Her mouth moved, but Aurora had to put her ear close to hear.

“She says she’s too far from the forest. She can’t cast any charms.” Aurora picked the tea towel up and carried Lily out of the house again and near to the back fence. Nick watched her put the towel down on the grass, and as soon as Aurora backed away, a young woman with dark short hair and eyes and pale skin was there. She was a full-sized version of the tiny pixie, without wings.

She was not well, though. She slumped back down to sitting sideways on the tea towel, her head in her hands.

“Everything’s gone wrong,” Lily said in that lilting accent. “Solon is gone.”

## Chapter Fourteen: Plan B

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

“What do you mean, he’s gone?” asked Aurora. She knelt down next to the distraught pixie. She put an arm around her shoulders for comfort.

“They came for us,” sniffed Lily. “The charms held them for a while, but then we had to run. He didn’t make it.”

“Did they capture him?” Aurora asked softly.

“No, he’s dead.” Lily scrubbed at her eyes. “He couldn’t fly as fast as me. He fell back and they clipped one of his wings with a cutting curse.”

“Isn’t she the one in the video?” asked Jimmy. He was looking at Lily, holding his radio control and goggles dangling in one hand.

Lily looked up with tears in her eyes, but managed a smile. “Hi Jimmy. You’ve grown even more than your sister. Same with you, Seve.” Jimmy stared, wide-eyed.

“It’s you,” he said. “I recognize your voice. I—I don’t remember what happened very well.” He looked abashed. “I think I held your friends prisoner for a bit. Sorry about that.”

“Why did they come for you?” asked Aurora, her brows pulled down in annoyance at the interruption. “I thought you were neutral.”

“Well my intervention yesterday changed their minds. Solon tried to warn me, but I didn’t listen.”

“Wait,” said Nick. “They attacked you because you helped us?”

“They did,” said Lily.

“That’s sick,” Nick breathed. “I was helpless and you stepped in.”

“Yeah, well the goal was to break your neck running you off the cliff,” Lily said with bitterness. “I stopped that from happening. They reported that back and I guess Dereg didn’t like that.”

The question was forming on Aurora’s lips, but Lily interrupted. “It was *all* of them,” she said. “The full dozen. They wanted us dead or gone. Now there’s only me, and they will come for me as soon as they report back where I am. I shouldn’t have attacked those four, but I was angry.” She looked up at the position of the sun. “It shouldn’t be long. They might come right away, but they will come eventually.”

“We need to call Constable Jeffries,” said Nick. The girls looked at him. “She should be able to focus on this place. Then when the faeries come…” the words died in his throat when he saw the skeptical looks they were giving him. “What?” he asked.

“Is the Constable a policeman?” asked Lily. When Nick nodded, she gave a sympathetic look. “I saw two dead dogs in the forest as I was being chased. There might have been a body, but I couldn’t stop. We could go look, I could show you.”

“That’s horrible,” said Jimmy. “Someone killed a dog?”

“We need to think this though,” said Aurora. “Can you stand? Can you come inside?” she asked Lily. She helped Lily up, and Nick took her other arm and they led her limping into the house and shut the patio door behind themselves. Jimmy and Seve followed, Jimmy carrying his drone with him.

“That was some quick thinking, Jimmy,” said Nick.

“What?” asked Lily. She was sitting at the kitchen table and eyeing Jimmy and his quadcopter.

“After you fell, Jimmy chased them off,” said Nick. “Was bloody fantastic.”

“I was wondering why they hadn’t finished me off,” said Lily. “Thank you, Jimmy. I owe you.”

“It’s nothing,” said Jimmy. “I saw you fighting. I thought it wasn’t fair, one on four.” He grinned. “I always wanted to do something like that. There’s a drone laser tag league, but Mom won’t let us try. Figure they crash too many times. They looked like little drones to me, flitting about.”

“Little drones that can’t go much past the property line,” said Aurora absently.

“What?” asked Nick. “Why not?”

Aurora looked surprised at the question. She looked at Lily for a moment, and Lily nodded. “They are… powered by the forest. Not exactly,” she said when Lily frowned and opened her mouth. “They get energy from the life of the forest. Much past that and they lose their magic. Can they fly?” she asked Lily.

“A bit. Not nearly as far as in the forest. But charms are out,” said Lily. “I couldn’t do much here. Couldn’t shrink back down. I’m just… normal to you right now.”

A silence fell over the kitchen. Everybody had their own thoughts. Nick felt like there was something to what she had said. It wasn’t anything like a plan, but he felt like he had to put it out there.

“What if we could take the faeries out of the forest?”

There was a silence, and then Aurora and Lily spoke at once. “Sorry, you go first,” said Aurora.

“They’d be in sad shape,” Lily said. “But you’d never get them out. There’s nothing outside the forest that they want. They want the forest and to get humans away.”

“How would you get them out? You saw how four of them were a handful for Lily to try to fight.” Aurora’s brow was furrowed. She wasn’t arguing, she was providing a counterpoint.

“I also saw them scattered by your brother,” said Nick. “There’s got to be some sort of an answer there.”

“Hey, I have a drone, too!” said Seve in a petulant tone.

“Yes, you do,” said Aurora. “That’s still three against twelve, though.” She lapsed into silence.

Soon, everybody was sitting around the kitchen table, suggesting ideas. Every idea that came forward was shot down because of one detail or another. The problem was that the faeries controlled the forest. It was like they had the high ground. Any attack against it was going to be an uphill battle. When the boys got bored, Aurora organized them to make some grilled cheese and canned soup. The light was starting to fail outside and the room was filled with the smells of cooking. That helped to energize the conversation but a solution was still elusive.

“We need to pick them off, one by one,” said Aurora.

The doorbell rang. Everyone looked at each other, but then laughter broke out. All of them had imagined the faeries ringing the doorbell before coming to attack them.

Nick went to get it, and there on the doorstep were the formal elegance of Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson. The surprise must have shown on his face.

“Yes, I am hale and ready to rejoin the living, Mr. Jackson,” said Mr. Beattie, flicking an imaginary speck of dust off of his lapel. “I tired of getting no answers to text messages, so decided to come here. Apparently, my guess was good, unless your being here is a social visit to Miss Johnstone?”

Nick flushed. “Come in, we’re in the kitchen.” He led the way in. When they reached the kitchen, Mr. Beattie and Miss Patterson stopped dead.

“Who…” said Miss Patterson, but recognition crossed her face at the same time as a smile split Mr. Beattie’s.

“Please introduce us,” said Mr. Beattie to Aurora as he came to the table and pulled out a chair. He didn’t sit, just waited for Aurora.

“Mr. Beattie, this is Lily Merriweather,” said Aurora. “Lily, this is Mr. Beattie. He is our boss, and the person who started us looking in the forest.” Lily frowned at that, but Mr. Beattie extended a hand and she shook it.

“Charmed,” he said. “This is not the first time we have met,” he said. Both Aurora and Lily looked surprised. “A considerable time ago I had the pleasure of spotting Miss Merriweather when I was in the forest. They were more carefree days. It seemed as though my brain was trying to play tricks on me but I decided that I trusted my brain.” He looked at Lily. “I made it my purpose to prove that I had not imagined things.”

The color drained out of Lily’s face. “You mean this is all my fault?”

“That would depend on what you mean by ‘this’, my dear,” said Mr. Beattie. “Me looking for you and engaging the services of Mr. Jackson and Miss Johnstone? Then yes. The battle between your kind and mine? No. That started before we searched in earnest.”

“They aren’t my kind,” objected Lily. Mr. Beattie looked confused.

“Lily is a pixie,” said Aurora. “The ones doing the damage are faeries.” That didn’t seem to help, so Aurora kept going. “They are two different species. They both ended up here. In that, you were right, they were invasive species.” She smiled at Nick. “They are very similar, but there is… tension between their kinds.”

“I sense that you have direct experience in this, Miss Johnstone,” said Mr. Beattie. Aurora flushed. “That is extraordinary. I needed a coder, and not only did I get a gem of a resource, one who lives next to the forest, but one who was already acquainted with these creatures.” His tone lost its formality. “Why didn’t you mention it?”

“Some of us weren’t ready to admit what we’d experienced, Mr. Beattie. I was only eight. Jimmy was five.”

“I was one!” said Seve from where he was drying dishes and Jimmy was washing them.

“Yes. And I suppressed it, Mr. Beattie. This has been a very upsetting and disorienting few days,” said Aurora.

At Aurora’s direction, Nick found a kettle and a teapot and started boiling some water while the girls filled in the newcomers on what had happened. Miss Patterson interjected with some probing questions but Mr. Beattie listened in silence. When Lily explained the way that her kind was symbiotic with the forest and that the damage to the forest had forced most of them to leave, Mr. Beattie stood and moved to the window taking his teacup with him. He looked out at the dusk and the dark shape of the forest over the fence. He didn’t seem to be listening any more, but Aurora kept explaining to Miss Patterson. Jimmy swelled with pride when she described how he had saved Lily by scattering the faeries.

“Lily said she thought that the police might have already met a sticky end in the forest,” said Aurora.

“I don’t know that for sure. Remember, I was flying for my life at the time.”

“We were trying to come up with a plan,” Aurora said. Her chin was set as she looked at Miss Patterson as though challenging her to say they shouldn’t.

“It’s war,” said Nick.

“It is,” said Mr. Beattie suddenly from the window. He turned to survey the others. “I can honestly say I had no intention that things might lead to this.”

“As you said, Mr. Beattie, its not your fault,” said Miss Patterson. Lily gave a begrudging nod. “But I think it’s important to point out that we are not exactly well-positioned to wage war against these creatures.”

“We were coming to the same conclusion,” said Nick. “We think there is a solution. There’s only twelve of them. If we could only divide and conquer.”

“Pick off one at a time,” said Aurora. “Like wolves singling out a single caribou from the herd.”

“But this is only a herd of twelve,” said Mr. Beattie thoughtfully. “And they guard their territory jealously. Lily, honestly speaking, what are your strengths compared to our adversaries?”

“Lily’s been studying magic with Solon for ten years,” said Aurora.

“Yeah, but I can only use it in the forest, the same as them. I could probably come up with something creative for three or four at a time, but I don’t think I will get that chance.” Lily looked sheepish. “I wasn’t thinking straight this afternoon. I let my emotions get the best of me. I almost paid with my life.”

“What about about aerobatics?” Mr. Beattie asked.

“About the same. They might beat me in a straight line. They are a little bigger,” said Lily.

“Do you think you can stand something more extreme?” asked Mr. Beattie.

“Like what?” Lily asked.

It dawned on Nick what Mr. Beattie meant.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Aurora felt her nerves tingling. She hadn’t slept at all last night. Once there was a plan of action, everyone had jumped at the opportunity to help. Aurora had been worried that Lily would balk at fighting back, but something had changed in her. They hadn’t had a moment alone to talk about it, but Aurora had been thankful when she had listened to the plan and agreed to help.

Nick had gone with Miss Patterson to spend some time at the fabrication shop that he had mentioned. Mr. Beattie had been to the local pet stores and Jimmy and Seve had all of their batteries charged fully, including the ones in their remote controllers and headsets.  It had seemed that everyone had a job to do, except Aurora. She had taken on the responsibility of coordinating and overseeing that everything was being done. They had moved their operatations back to Mr. Beattie’s house and Aurora had taken Jimmy and Seve back home to take them to bed later than they should have. Then Aurora had set a guard, sitting in the dark with a fire extinguisher, waiting for morning. Mom didn’t come home at all, only texting to her three children that Dad was still fighting and she would be staying at the hospital.

The night had been long, with Aurora alone with her thoughts in the dark of the kitchen. Her ears pricked up at every sound, but there was no sign that the faeries were trying to attack. If they had, that would almost have been preferable to Aurora. The faeries knew which house was hers, and Lily had been here. That they didn’t attack was foreboding. It meant that they weren’t thinking like she would have. If she couldn’t anticipate what they would do, then how could she think that their plan would work?

Thoughts of Nick had kept stealing into her mind, distracting her. They had had some actual *banter*. His familiarity with *The Princess Bride* said a lot about him, she thought. Every time she thought he might turn a leaf and show his true colors weren’t what she thought, he kept surprising her. And that moment with his hair… she had blushed in the dark at the thought. *What was I thinking?* she asked herself. But he had seemed to like it.

But those thoughts had not stayed for long. There were enough noises in the night that they had kept her awake and keyed up until the sky was gray with morning. The boys were up by six and hyped up to go.

“I don’t think you two have ever been out of bed this early,” Aurora had said as she had left them with their breakfast and she had gone to shower and get ready.

Now, she straightened her vest and flexed her fingers. It was time to put their plan into action. Her own back fence was at her back. Aurora was aware of eyes on her, and she hoped that the faeries’ eyes were among them.

With a stride more confident than she felt, Aurora moved away from the fence and foreward into the woods. She pulled out her phone and brought up the music app. She swiped a bit, and then picked one of her Dad’s favorites. The first guitar chords of *Into The Great Wide Open* by Tom Petty rang out in the quiet forest. It gave her some confidence. Maybe she felt like her dad was watching out for her. There was a stinging of tears in her eyes, but she blinked them away.

She sang along as she walked. She wasn’t going to go too far in, so she started turning to the left and right, making a zigzag pattern. When she got as far as she was supposed to, she turned and made her way parallel to the forest edge and then started to walk back towards the houses. It took all her self-control not to look in the direction of Lily.

Aurora’s heart was pounding. Something had to happen soon, she was sure of it…

Her first indication wasn’t the sound of a faerie’s wings, it was the sudden whine of the quadcopter. Once it was in the air, Aurora did as she was told: she dropped flat to the forest floor. She looked up and in a moment, focused on the scene above.

The drone was easy to spot as it moved, but it was hard to get a bead on: part of the evening had been spent painting both Jimmy’s and Seve’s drones in forest camoflauge colors. They were now mostly green and brown. This was Jimmy’s, as planned. The drone darted, and there was a ripping sound as the battle began.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Jimmy was keyed up. He kept his fingers away from his controls because he didn’t trust himself not to touch them and give the whole thing away. He and Seve had spent most of the evening before talking with the pixie, Lily. They had to work as a team. He knew what he had to do, and it excited him. It was the first time that he had ever felt so much like a part of a team.

He had asked her questions. Some she had not wanted to answer, but others she had been free to answer. She had filled in some of his memories of the time he had spent in the forest ten years ago. He barely remembered most of it. She had been gentle, but he felt acutely embarrassed that he had been a tool of Dereg, and had been fighting for the side that was killing people now, and had wanted to kill him back then. He was going to have to ask Aurora what she remembered, when all of this was over. It was clear that none of this was his imagination, like he had thought it was for years.

She hadn’t wanted to talk to him about Solon, or what she planned to do to the faeries today when they engaged. She had spent a lot of time thinking and he thought he saw her lips moving silently and her fingers tracing patterns when no one was looking.

“Where are your wings?” he’d asked her. “You had some before.”

“They are a thing of our magic,” she had told him. “Right now, I’m not very magic at all. If I had my wings, I wouldn’t be able to lift myself into the air. I’d have to be small to do it.”

“Makes sense,” Seve had said, surprising her. “Small drones don’t take much power. Big ones are more like planes and need big rotors to stay airborne.”

“Yes, I suppose that’s right,” she had said and tousled his hair. Seve had blushed.

Jimmy pushed the thoughts out of his head. He listened attentively to the speaker in his ear. He had a headset, with a microphone on a boom in front of his mouth. He was in the dark: his headset was off to save battery. When the word came, he was supposed to flick it on, turn on his controller and then it was showtime.

“You can do it, Jimmy,” said Seve beside him. “I know you can.”

“Thanks little buddy,” said Jimmy back. “I—” He didn’t get to finish his thought, because the agreed-on word came through the speaker in his ear. It was Lily’s voice.

“Tinkerbell.”

Jimmy’s fingers jumped for the headset switch and the controller switch. In one second, both were starting up and in two more, they were ready. The slightly grainy stereo view of the forest floor came into view. Jimmy’s hands went to the sticks on his controller, but he didn’t touch them. It wasn’t time yet. He was supposed to wait for the next code word.

The view from his drone jiggled slightly, and then he heard the word: “Neverland.”

Twenty meters away, Jimmy’s drone flared to full power and it jumped upwards.

“One o’clock high!” came the strained voice of the pixie. Jimmy rotated the drone without thought and his target came into view. There was a single faerie zeroing in on his sister. The view in his goggles was attuned to shapes and motion, and color didn’t register well, but he could see the bright orange safety vest and the red of her hair. She had dropped to the ground, covering her head with her hands. The faerie was only about ten meters away from her and flying fast.

“No you don’t,” growled Jimmy. He moved the stick forward and the rest was a test of his piloting skills.

Lily was positioned high up on a branch of an oak, in the middle of the square area where Aurora was supposed to walk. She had transformed her clothes and skin to be camoflauge colors. It was a simple enough charm. Jimmy had goggled when he had watched her do it. The important thing was keeping still. If she did, there was no way that she would be seen. She looked down briefly. The shape of Jimmy’s drone was visible below her in the leaf clutter, but only if you knew what to look for. They were silent and they were invisible.

Lily heard Aurora start playing music as they had agreed on. Then her footsteps seemed so loud in the quiet of the forest. Humans were so large and heavy; they couldn’t help how much noise they made. But that was the point. They wanted to make as much noise as possible without seeming like it.

She didn’t turn her head to watch Aurora’s progress. Her job was to be on the alert for incoming faeries. Her eyes scanned the forest at all levels. Dereg had to have at least one scout out this morning. They hadn’t attacked in the night, but it was almost guaranteed that one faerie was within earshot of the racket Aurora was making.

A flicker of motion drew her eye. It took only a moment for her to spot and track it. It was a faerie, and it landed briefly on a branch above Lily’s position, still some thirty meters distant. She put a finger to the device on her ear, and whispered “Tinkerbell”.

The faerie was watching Aurora as she turned and started to change her path back towards the houses. When the girl’s back was to the faerie, it was like Lily could see the faerie decide that this was an opportunity that was too good to pass up. He took off in Aurora’s direction.

Lily stepped off the branch and fell straight down, only flaring her wings at the last moment as she touched down on the drone. She grabbed the little loop of twine that they had attached to the back of the quadcopter last night. She left the channel open to Jimmy and said “Neverland”.

She managed to take a breath before she was flattened against the plastic shell of the drone. It went up breathtakingly fast, but Lily knew she was in for much worse.

“One o’clock high,” she said as she spotted the faerie again. The drone pivoted and leaped forward. Lily wound her hands and feet into the twine and held on. The earth and sky and trees tilted and blurred. It was almost too much for her brain, even though she had been flying since she could walk.

In moments, the drone was right behind the attacking faerie. He seemed to realize that he was being followed, because he broke off the attack and slowed and turned, but that was a mistake.

“Too easy,” Lily breathed. A simple concussive charm that she had ready snapped in both of the faerie’s ears. Immediately, the dazed faerie stopped flying and started to fall.

The drone dropped to follow, and in a trice, the wire mesh net dangling below the drone swallowed the falling creature. As soon as Lily saw the successful catch, she yelled into the microphone. “Good catch, good catch, good catch!”

The quadcopter rotated and blazed forward. In seconds it was out of the forest and screaming over rooftops. The first row of houses out of the forest they flew over first, then the houses facing them and their neighbours, and then the busy road.

Lily felt the power of the forest drain out of her immediately, and she felt fear. Fear that she had placed her trust and safety in these humans: she would be helpless when they landed. Fear that she might fall and nothing would save her. There was nothing that she could do about either except hold on tightly.

Lily had barely registered the appearance of the parking lot that was their destination, when the drone was flaring, scrubbing its speed. There was what Mr. Beattie had called a “mini-mall”, a long row of stores with a concrete parking lot. He had suggested it when Lily had described how the little folk drew their strength from the life of the forest. The mini mall was only two blocks away from the forest, but was a desert where no life grew. It was perfect.

It was early on a Saturday morning and there were no cars in the parking lot, except for one rental van. Mr. Beattie and Nick were standing next to the van, with Nick ready to grab the netted faerie from the drone.

The quadcopter hovered at about one meter above the concrete, and Nick came close enough. His giant dark hands reached forward. He was a giant to Lily, and she had no way of fleeing or fighting back if he chose to grab her too. But he did not. His hands disappeared below her vision to where the net dangled. In five seconds, he lifted the stunned, flightless faerie from the net and turned to Mr. Beattie.

Mr. Beattie was holding a pet carrying case with the door open. It was sized for a small cat, which meant that there was plenty of space for the faerie. Nick put the creature gently inside and then they closed the wire door.

“One,” said Nick.

“Returning to base,” came Jimmy’s voice in Lily’s ear. She just had time to hold on to the twine loops before her ride spiralled up and shot back to Aurora’s house.

As she came closer, it was a physical relief when the energy flooded back into her. As the drone descended to land in Aurora’s back yard, Lily let go and flew down to rest her own two feet on the ground. She had a minute before the battery in the drone was exchanged and they would be ready to hunt again. Lily luxuriated in the feeling of being close to the trees again. *I am whole again.*

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Seve was the pilot this time. Jimmy was taking a break. He had flown three successful missions and everyone was trying to not celebrate too soon. But everyone had a smile and they were clapping Jimmy on the back in congratulations for doing his job so well. Seve wanted to show all the grown ups that he was just as good as Jimmy. When they raced, he won almost half the time. Jimmy was older, but age wasn’t important. It was reflexes and instinct.

He bit his lip. He was in the dark, with his goggles on but turned off. He listened to the sounds of the yard. Behind him, he could hear Miss Patterson speaking softly on her phone. He thought she was talking to Mr. Beattie but he couldn’t hear what she was saying.

His drone was in the forest, spun down and hiding in the leaf litter. The earpiece in his ear was silent. He knew the code word to listen for, but right now there was nothing. There was no way of knowing when another faerie might come along. The first one had appeared almost immediately, but the following two had taken time. They didn’t know if the following faeries had been sent to look for the first one, or if they were just happening by and finding Aurora wandering in their domain. Either way, Seve had no way of knowing how long he would have to wait. He sat in one of the patio chairs, trying to be calm, just like before a race.

Dad had always tried to give him tricks to concentrate or put stress out of his mind. That made Seve sad. It had taken him a day or more to realize that when Mom said that Dad wasn’t well that it meant he might be dying. That seemed so unfair to Seve: he’d only been around for eleven years and he didn’t want to lose Dad. He trusted the doctors, though. They would help Dad and then they would be a family again.

“Tinkerbell.”

Seve jumped, and fumbled a bit at powering up his goggles and the drone. The view of the forest floor lit up his vision.

Seve’s heart was pounding. Suddenly it didn’t seem like such a good idea for him to take a turn. Jimmy had been doing so well. He was about to open his mouth to call to Jimmy to take over for him, when the drone’s point of view shook. Lily had landed on the drone.

“Neverland.”

Seve bobbled the takeoff a bit, but then he said a word that his mom didn’t know he knew. “Get it together, man,” he said to himself.

“Ten o’clock level,” came Lily’s voice. Seve swiveled the drone, spotted the target and then let his instincts take over.

This faerie might have been warned or might have been on the alert because of his missing friends, but she evaded immediately. The faerie dove hard for the forest floor and then skimmed her toes on the leaf litter. Seve pushed his drone to the limit, pulling out so low that he worried he might catch the net on the ground. He accelerated.

The faerie darted back and forth, trying to evade the heavy drone with agility, but Seve had the advantage of speed. All he needed to do was get close enough for Lily to incapacitate her.

There was a flash in his display, but when Seve’s eyes cleared, the faerie was still flying away. “Did you miss?” he said.

“Incoming!” Lily’s voice shouted into his earpiece. “Three more at four o’clock high!”

There were more flashes in his view, but Seve drove on after the fleeing girl faerie. He had to execute a one-eighty flipping turn when she doubled back. As his view of the forest spun, he caught a glimpse of the pursuers. They were three blurred dark shapes against the sky that disappeared as he completed his turn. He was focused on his target as more flashes popped.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Lily ducked as a charm flashed by. Seve’s piloting was breathtaking. There was a violent aspect to it that made Jimmy’s acrobatics seem gentle. It hurt, but it meant that the following three faeries had almost no chance of hitting them.

Lily thought it had been a trap, but when only three had appeared, she had changed her mind. If Dereg had wanted to trap them, there would be every remaining faerie here. This was probably a team sent to discover why three of their number hadn’t reported in. That meant they still had the advantage: they were outnumbered but the attackers were trying to figure out what they were dealing with.

Looking ahead, they were almost on top of the faerie that they were chasing. Lily thought that this one was Alena. She hadn’t mentioned to the humans that she knew all of the faeries in Dereg’s faction. She and Alena had actually spent time together before the People had been forced to leave. She was a nice person and was skilled at healing and potions. Her singing made Lily’s own attempts seem like a frog croaking. Lily tried to put that out of her mind.

There was no chance for her to do the stun-and-catch that had worked so well three times. There was no chance for Seve to catch Alena: he would need to keep evading to protect her and the drone. Lily didn’t want to injure or kill Alena. She made her mind up and prepared her charm.

Seve got her into position, and Lily let go with one hand and worked the incantation. Her charm flew true. What looked like a crystal sphere popped into place around Alena. Immediately, she was immobilized, caught in a prison barely larger than she was. The sphere fell in a ballistic path. Seve made a good attempt to catch it, but he missed. The ball fell until it hit the ground. It bounced, and then Lily lost sight of it.

“I missed!” said Seve over the radio.

“I know, I know!” replied Lily. “Turn and let’s get the chasers!”

In a moment, the chase was reversed. The four electric engines screamed in Lily’s ears as they clawed at the air, almost sending her flipping off the drone.

“For the love of light, Seve! You almost lost me!”

“Sorry.” His boyish voice carried some sympathy, but the brutal ride continued.

Seve dove straight at the triad of chasers, plowing through the middle and forcing them to scatter. Lily had no chance to cast a charm, and the suddeness of the maneuver caught the faeries by surprise. Lily smiled despite her situation as she saw the terrified faces as they flashed by.

The maneuver had broken up the formation, and Lily had no need to give instructions. Seve had turned the drone and was now chasing one. Unfortunately, the other two faeries were close and one of them got in a lucky shot.

A stinging curse hit Lily in the back. Horrible pain flared through her, almost making her black out. She held onto her straps as her hands spasmed.

“Lily! Are you okay?” came Seve’s voice.

“Fine,” Lily said through gritted teeth. More charms shot by. “We’re in trouble,” she grunted. The pain was fading, but not quickly. It was impossible for her to focus on making a charm of her own.

“Should I break off?” said Seve. “I’m at thirty percent battery.”

Lily was considering it, when there was a rush of air. It buffeted the drone she was on, almost making her lose her grasp.

It was another drone.

“Jimmy!” Seve’s voice was jubilant in her ear. Lily turned to see Jimmy’s drone scatter the pursuers. The charms stopped crashing around them and that gave her enough time and calm to focus and prepare.

Seve hadn’t let anything distract him: he was still on the tail of the faerie ahead. They were close enough now.

“Seve, tell Jimmy to watch for me! You catch this one and go to the mini mall. I’ll jump off!” The response from Seve might have been affirmative, but Lily was focused so hard on her task that she couldn’t hear. Her charm flew true and in a moment, their quarry was falling from the sky. Seve performed a perfect catch and Lily let go and sprang upwards.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Jimmy was flying hard, and he didn’t know what was going on. He had been resting, when Seve had started yelling. He had gathered that they were in trouble. Before Miss Patterson could say anything, he had his goggles on and his drone in the air.

He had found the dogfight quickly enough but now he was in trouble. He could dodge and dive as much as he wanted, but his chasers had all the weapons. Sparks and flashes flickered in his headset. He hadn’t considered that he would be a sitting duck. It seemed only a matter of time before his drone was hit and then what would he do?

He heard Seve yell. “Miss Patterson! Give my headset to Jimmy!” Trapped in his VR world, Jimmy couldn’t see what Seve was doing, and being chased as he was, he couldn’t direct his drone to see what was happening. “Jimmy! Lily’s in the air! Find her!”

“Find her? I’m about to get shot down!” Jimmy snapped. He tried to ignore when fingers started putting an earpiece on him. His drone wobbled from a near miss as the sound of Lily’s voice came into his ear.

“… just above your nine o’clock.” Her voice was breathy, like she was running. “Come left, come left.”

Jimmy did, and saw another moving figure. It was Lily. He kept the drone on a straight course, and was rewarded by seeing his drone shake from the impact with the pixie girl, and hearing her speak in his ear.

“I’m on.”

“All right,” Jimmy growled. He had offence as well as defence now.

It was over in minutes. Lily’s charm skills while riding the bucking and diving drone were getting better, and Jimmy was now getting much better at coming up behind the fleeing faeries. Once they were in the airspace directly in front of Jimmy, Lily didn’t miss.

The last faerie, a girl, fell to Lily’s crystal-sphere charm and joined the two others, bouncing to a stop below. She had tried to run, but even flat-out she was no match for the straight-line speed that the quadcopter could muster.

Seve’s drone returned from dropping off his stunned faerie with Mr. Beattie’s rental truck. With a fresh battery, Seve and Jimmy delivered these faeries, too. As the drones flew out of the effect zone of the forest, the crystalline spheres evaporated, but they left powerless, flightless tiny people clinging to the nets below the drones. They were so disoriented by the effect of the charm and the flight that they did not resist when they were carefully put into their carrying cases.

Seven of the twelve faeries were now captured.

## Chapter Fourteen: Parlay

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

It was a motley group of people standing in the parking lot of the mini-mall. If anyone had noticed them, they would have seen an oddly-dressed man in a morning-coat, a respectably-dressed younger woman, two young students, one with black and one with red curly hair, and two young boys, all huddled around a Budget car rentals van.

What they would not have seen was the tiny figure of a young woman, who was in the back of the van, speaking with seven more tiny figures in cages.

Two of the captured faeries were angry, and threatened violence to Lily as she spoke to them, but the rest were relieved that it was over. They sat quietly in their pet carrying cases, silently contemplating what would happen to them. They were all still disoriented by the lack of forest energy. They had been working on the fringes of the woods to conduct their war, but it was entirely different to be here in this concrete wasteland. Lily knew the feeling, and she commiserated with the long faces and lifeless eyes that looked back at her from their prisons.

Lily knew them all by sight, but only Alena counted as a friend to her. She wanted to know what would happen to her.

“I… I want… Can you take a message to Arthyen?” she asked. She was leaning against the wall of her cage, her arms hugging herself.

“Arthyen?” asked Lily. She thought she recognized the name. “Taller, green eyes?”

Alena nodded. There was a moment of silence. “We—we were married. Last year. I wouldn’t want him to not know what happened to me.”

Lily’s heart twisted at that. She could only imagine feeling the same, wanting her family to know if she fell. She nodded.

“How many of you are partnered?” Lily asked.

“Alena, be quiet!” yelled Trevik, one of the two faeries who were still angry at their capture. “Dereg will take your wings if you so much as whisper another word!”

Lily moved, walking, to stand in front of Trevik’s cage. His face was flushed with emotion, and he glared at Lily through the bars. She made sure to keep her distance: she didn’t trust that he wouldn’t try to attack her through the bars.

“You are welcome to remain silent, Trevik, but please stop threatening the others,” Lily said calmly.

“Traitor! You are a traitor to your kind!” he spat. Some spittle from his lips nearly reached her toes, so Lily took a step back.

“I understand you,” said Lily.

“No you don’t! You’ve conspired with the humans! You are no better than they!”

“You mean I haven’t killed innocent people, like them? I tried to stop the violence, like them? Then I take that as a compliment.” Lily met Trevik’s glare, and he quieted. She didn’t know if he felt shame for his acts, but it didn’t matter right now.

“I stood aside for too long, and now I have to live with that for my whole life,” she said in barely more than a whisper. “At the wishes of a man who eventually became one of your victims. At least I stood up before it was too late. Think about that. Think about what you have done.”

Lily returned to Alena’s cage.

“Your family crossed the water to the United States, right?” she asked.

Alena looked up with confusion. “No, that’s not right.” She spared a glance at Trevik’s cage, but he said nothing. “They went west. The last village before wilderness. Port Renfrew. That was where they were headed.”

“Oh.” said Lily. “That’s interesting. I thought they were farther away, like my People went.”

“It was far enough,” Alena mused. “What will happen to us?” she asked.

“I don’t know,” said Lily as she left the van. It was the truth.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

“We need to see if Constable Jeffries truly is in need of assistance in the forest!” said Nick. He was thrilled that the operation had gone so well this morning. His steel nets to catch and transport the faeries had worked better than he expected. But they couldn’t wait any longer to start a search.

“We have seven, imagine if we could catch them all,” said Mr. Beattie, his eyes aglow.

“You know that if they come again, they won’t fall for it again,” said Aurora.

Jimmy nodded. “We just barely managed to beat four and they were surprised. One lucky hit and the drone is down. They ain’t war drones, they’re racing drones.”

“We could come up with a variation,” said Mr. Beattie. “Each trapped faerie means they have less ability to defend. Two more and we might be able to sweep the forest, taking the battle to them!”

“And then what?” asked Aurora. “What happens to them?” she jerked a thumb at the van.

There was an awkward silence. It had been bugging Nick, so he was glad Aurora had mentioned it. They had prisoners, but no plan.

“I had thought… well, the research possibilities…” said Mr. Beattie.

“Dissect them?” said Aurora.

“What? No!” he protested.

“Keep them surrounded by concrete for the rest of their lives? You can’t take them to your house,” Aurora pointed out. “Your garden would be enough to give them some energy. Maybe enough to escape. The university would be the same problem. You can’t enter it without passing wooded areas.”

“We could study the effect. We could understand so much about them,” Mr. Beattie protested. He looked to Miss Patterson for support, but she refused to meet his eyes.

“We could also just euthanize them and then it wouldn’t be a problem any more,” said Miss Patterson. When there was a sharp intake of breath from everyone. “They are murderers,” she said. She knew the effect her words were having on the others. “If we are going to imprison them forever to be lab rats, then we might as well do that, it would be more humane.”

That silenced Mr. Beattie.

Nick noticed Lily. She had come out from the back of the van and was standing on the bumper, waving to them. He was the first to notice and went over to the pixie. She was still gesturing. He put out his hand for her to stand on. The tiny weight of her feet was so strange on his palm. Nick brought Lily up and carefully deposited her on his shoulder. Her tiny hands grabbed onto his earlobe for support and he could hear her faint voice clearly.

“Let me speak,” she said.

“Lily wants to say something,” said Nick. Everyone was watching him already.

“If I was to fight the five remaining faeries, it would be a draw at best,” she said into his ear. Nick repeated what she said. “I don’t think this tactic will work again. We might come up with something else, but with risk. I think we can end this in one stroke.”

Everyone waited expectantly.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

Two hours later, Aurora, Nick, Jimmy and Miss Patterson entered the woods with Lily flying overhead. Miss Patterson had a first-aid kit with her in the hopes that they would find Constable Jeffries alive. Jimmy had his drone in a canvas bag, and his goggles were on his forehead and remote control dangled from a strap around his neck. They walked in single file, holding hands. Lily had recommended it.

“If they try to trick you with illusions, it will be almost impossible to fool your sense of touch,” she had said. “Hold tight, and realize what is happening to you. Humans have a natural defensive reaction to faerie magic. You only have to realize it for what it is. Your touch with your neighbours should be enough to deny it.”

Nick felt odd, like some weird kindergarten cosplay, holding hands with Miss Patterson and Aurora. But once he got past the strangeness and embarrassment, it was nice to hold Aurora’s hand. It was thinner than his, with more delicate fingers. They almost reminded him of Lily’s tiny hands and feet, but that was silly.

Lily was airborne, returned to her natural habitat. They were under her protection. If they were attacked, she would do her best to defend them, and Jimmy would help if he could. But they were entering the heart of the woods and there was no quick escape for them if they needed it.

Nick’s senses were on high alert, and every time Lily moved from tree to tree above them, he watched for any sign that they were in danger. The thrum of her wings was so close to that of the faeries that it made his heart skip a beat every time she launched herself. Aurora had explained how Solon’s wife Lunid had managed to incapacitate every faerie *and* pixie in the forest with a single charm. “Lily’s been studying with Solon for ten years, and she was an impressive charm caster back then,” she had said. The words had been comforting in the open space of the roadway, walking towards the forest entrance, but now that they were in enemy territory it wasn’t much comfort.

“She says that the place where she saw the police dogs is just ahead,” said Aurora. She had the earpiece and was the only one who could speak to Lily. Nick adjusted his grip on Aurora’s hand and she squeezed back.

It didn’t take long to find. Two german shepherd corpses lay on the forest floor, with flies buzzing around them and crows with bloody beaks pecking at their remains. Nick felt his gorge rise. *Don’t let me puke in front of Aurora,* he thought. Desperately, he thought of other things and avoided looking at the dogs.

Together, the four humans swept the area as Lily flew overhead.

“There’s no sign of anyone else,” said Aurora. Nick didn’t know if she was reporting what Lily saw, or it was her own observation. “The most likely location for the faeries’ home is that way.” She jutted her chin towards the southwest, just as Lily darted in that direction.

They left the dogs. Jimmy had suggested they bury them, but they didn’t have a shovel, and it would have meant they let go of each other. “We’ll come back,” said Miss Patterson.

It was more difficult moving through the uneven ground while holding onto each others’ hands, but they did their best. At least they weren’t climbing. They circled around snarls of underbrush, making a wandering path.

Nick’s first indication that they were at their destination was a tightening of Aurora’s grip. He looked at her and her eyes were wide, looking around. They stopped until Aurora indicated that they should go towards the clearing that was ahead and to their right.

Nick’s hands were sweating, and he wanted to wipe them, but he didn’t dare let go. He remembered all too well the effects of the faeries’ hypnosis on him. He didn’t see any cliffs to run off of, but those dogs didn’t die by hypnosis. He felt his feet dragging on the final steps before the clearing, but there was no going back now.

The direct sunlight in the clearing was dazzling, but he blinked to clear his eyes. He didn’t know what he was looking at at first, thinking there was a kneeling figure, but then he realized that it was a gnarled stump of an oak tree. It was weathered and mossy, but it made a meter-tall place for someone as small as a faerie to stand. And there was a faerie there.

It was a male, Nick could see by his build and to some extent his hair and dress. He stood with his legs firmly planted and his arms crossed over his chest. His eyes were dark and piercing and he glared at the humans as they entered the clearing. Nick and the others straightened their line, still holding hands and standing abreast, facing this faerie.

“It’s Dereg,” said Aurora.

“I know,” said Jimmy.

Nick wasn’t sure if it was an illusion, but a shimmer seemed to surround the clearing. Glancing behind him, the shimmer covered the way they had come as well. It was almost like looking at the forest through a heat haze, but the day wasn’t nearly hot enough for that.

“You have come,” said Dereg. Nick goggled at the volume of the voice. He was used to Lily being basically impossible to hear from more than a meter away when she was small.

“Amplification charm,” murmured Aurora. “He cast it.”

“You think you know our ways?” said Dereg. It was a challenging tone. “A barely-grown girl? You know nothing.”

“She knows enough,” said Lily, alighting on Aurora’s shoulder. Her voice was loud, too.

“If she knows anything, that is too much,” said Dereg. He nodded, and there was a thrum of wings from every direction.

Four more faeries alighted around the assembled humans and one pixie. Two were in the branches of the last trees behind them, and two more stood side-by-side with Dereg.

“You have brought me most of your little group,” continued Dereg. “That saves me the effort of finding them and ending them. I appreciate that.” He sneered at Lily.

“It’s only fair,” said Lily. “After all, you were nice enough to let us capture the rest of your followers.” There was an intake of breath from one of the guarding faeries up and left from where Nick was standing.

“Very clever,” said Dereg. “Before you leave this life to rejoin the Earth, I will learn everything from you on how you did that. Even if it takes pain to convince you. But before that, I will force you to return them to me.”

Nick felt the urge to say something, but he bit his tongue. They had agreed that Lily would be their spokesperson.

“I haven’t come here for threats, Dereg,” she said. “I have come for peace. This is going to end.”

“Or else?” he asked. He grinned.

“I said, no threats, Dereg,” Lily said. “I meant it. The war is over, we have come to dictate the terms of peace.”

“Peace? There will be no peace. We have only begun to fight. And we have won each battle. Soon the humans will flee. The forest will grow. We will win.”

“You are wrong,” Lily replied. “The humans would never allow that.”

“They cannot fight what they do not believe in. The police sent in three blind, blundering fools and two dogs. If that’s the best they can do, then we cannot fail to win.”

“They don’t need to believe in you,” said Lily. “Don’t you remember your history, Dereg? Even without belief in us, the humans could eradicate the whole woods. If they fear for their lives, they will remove the threat.” There was some uncomfortable shifting by the faeries flanking Dereg. “Even those who would fight to protect the woods would bow down to the will of the masses as soon as they connected the deaths with the woods. They wouldn’t need to understand it. They would demand an end to the fear, and their leaders would bow to the pressure. After all, what are some trees compared to the lives of their children? Canada is a country covered by trees.”

The faeries to either side of Dereg were clearly uncomfortable now.

“That will never happen,” said Dereg. “Any move by the humans against these woods would be their death.”

“Yes, you’ve already killed some police officers. As soon as they are known to have been lost here, many more will come. The forest will be overrun. And then what? You kill some few of the searchers? That will bring more searchers.”

“Then we lie low,” said Dereg. “Then resume the offensive when they lose interest. They can’t fight what they don’t believe in.”

“I bet you’ve told yourself that so many times that you believe it. But the humans have machines, chemicals, fire. Can you lie low as the forest is levelled? You would only find yourselves weakened and ready to be caught by roaming cats.”

For a moment, Nick envisioned what a cat would be like to a creature the size of a faerie. Without any magic to defend themselves, it would be like being hunted by a dinosaur.

“That will not happen,” said Dereg. “And the forest grows, even now. The saplings are taking root.”

“They are not,” said Lily. “We uprooted them before coming into the forest.” There were gasps from the faeries, and the uncertainty in their eyes was replaced by shock and then anger. There were a few looks towards Dereg, as though they were expecting the command to attack. Nick flexed his fingers around Aurora’s. She gave him a comforting squeeze in return.

“Arthyen,” said Lily. The faerie standing at Dereg’s right shoulder jerked in surprise at being addressed. “You must know by now that Alena was one of the ones taken this morning.”

“What did you do with her?” he yelled, anger in his tone. Dereg motioned Arthyen to silence, but more voices joined in. From the branches above them, there were other calls to ask for what had happened to the others.

“Where is Hedrek?”

“Berlewen? Where is she?”

“SILENCE!” shouted Dereg, his voice amplified to be louder than human. The calls for loved ones quieted.

“Enough! You, I will deal with now.” Dereg pointed at Lily. He raised a hand and opened his mouth to speak the words that would start the fighting, but Lily spoke once more.

“I said you have lost already. If you wish to see your loved ones again, you will stand down.”

“We will find them and free them!” shouted Dereg.

“They are already with the rest of your people,” said Lily.”

“What is this?” Dereg spluttered.

“They were taken by the flying vehicle that humans call a ‘helicopter’ to Port Renfrew thirty minutes ago. They are already gone.”

Silence fell.

“If you want to see them again, there will be a second flight offered by the human, Mr. Beattie. If not, you will suffer here everything that I described and worse. Because the humans have evidence that we exist. It will not be a matter of humans walking blindly into your world. We will be known. Their technology will find you. Their technology beat you this morning. You have already lost.” Her tone was not triumphant, it was sad.

“Maybe if you had fought with honor I might have continued to stand aside, but I could no longer do so. It is time for you all,” she looked around to the four faeries besides Dereg, “to find your honor. You are being offered a life. The alternative is being caught and studied in a lab or exterminated.”

“Traitor! You are a traitor to your kind!” Dereg’s eyes were mad with rage.

What happened next was too fast for Nick to follow. There were ripping sounds and flashes of light. He ducked down, not sure what direction the threat would come from, but in a moment, Dereg lay dead on the oak stump. Smoke rose from his form. None of the other faeries had joined in. Lily still stood on Aurora’s shoulder, untouched.

“I am Lily Merriweather, daughter of Brae and apprentice to Solon. I have spoken. You have my word. Come with us, and you will be reunited with your loved ones within the hour.”

Aurora let go of Nick’s hand and Jimmy’s hand on the other side. Nick looked at her, and seeing it was safe, let go of Miss Patterson.

It was over. The faeries all flew down to stand on the oak stump. They all took a moment of silence over their fallen leader, and then Dereg’s body flared in a white light. Nick averted his eyes and when he had blinked the lights out of his eyes, there was nothing left of Dereg except for a bit of gray ash.

Then the faeries turned to Lily and bowed together.

“Please take us to our loved ones,” said Arthyen.

Miss Patterson pulled out her phone and dialled. “It’s over,” she said.

## Chapter Fifteen: Aftermath

They all returned to Mr. Beattie’s house by the most expedient means. Lily cast a shrinking charm on all four humans and then made them light enough to carry. Nick found himself being carried by Arthyen, now a faerie about the same size as he. The forest now seemed a huge place. The experience of being flown through it by the very faeries they had moments before been opposing added to Nick’s disorientation.

“Is Alena truly all right?” asked Arthyen in his ear when they were airborne.

“She is,” said Nick.

“Then I won’t drop you,” said the faerie. Nick didn’t know if he was joking or not. He hoped he was.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

From Mr. Beattie’s house, Miss Patterson and Nick drove the faeries to the waterfront, where the helicopter awaited. Mr. Beattie had hired one of the helicopters that normally flew tourists for scenic flights around the southern end of the island.

Aurora and Jimmy waited at Mr Beattie’s house for them to return. Seve had gone with Mr. Beattie on the first helicopter flight. When the car returned with Miss Patterson, Nick and an excited Seve, Aurora let herself truly relax.

“’Rora! ’Rora!” he shouted as he jumped out of the back seat and slammed the door shut. “I got to fly in a helicopter! It was so cool!” Aurora greeted him with a hug and tousled his red hair.

Aurora’s eyes met Nick’s and he nodded with a smile. Aurora sighed and hugged her brother tighter. Jimmy joined in and made it a family group hug. Nick hung back, and Miss Patterson just watched, beaming.

“Come on, let’s go home,” Aurora said.

“Thank you, Aurora,” said Miss Patterson. “Jimmy, Seve. I’ve already told you ten times what an amazing job you did today.”

“Wouldn’t hurt to make it eleven,” said Jimmy. “Kidding! Kidding!” he said, laughing as he dodged Aurora’s smack.

“I’ll walk with you,” said Nick. “If it’s okay, Miss Patterson. Today’s not a work day, right?”

“Oh, I suppose you can take the rest of the day off, Mr. Jackson. But be her all the earlier on Monday morning!”

Aurora was grinning as they walked the short distance back to her house.

“What?” asked Nick.

“Nothing. It was a paraphrasing of a line from *A Christmas Carol.* I just found it funny.”

“Mom’s car is there,” said Seve, pointing. Aurora looked, and Mom’s car was in the driveway.

Reality came crashing down on her. No matter what they had accomplished, it was nothing if the news was bad. Her steps slowed, and she felt Nick’s hand entwine with hers again. He didn’t say anything, but just held on.

They went in the front door. Mom came rushing down the stairs. Her hair looked slept-on, and she was dressed the same as she had been two days ago.

“Where have you been?” she said as she swept them up in a hug. Jimmy squirmed, but quieted down.

“We’re fine, Mom,” said Aurora. “We were just out.”

Mom was crying.

*Oh, God,* thought Aurora.

“Your father,” she said. She broke down, trying to get words out. Soon Aurora was crying too. It felt good, after everything that had happened. She let go of everything she had been holding onto inside and let the tears flow.

“It’s okay, Mom,” she managed. “We’ll be okay without Dad.”

“Oh, no, no!” said Mom, struggling with her control. The tears were falling, but she was smiling. “I came home this morning to tell you that Dad is off the ventilator. He’s still in the ICU, but he’s going to be okay!”

There was nothing to be said, and all four Johnstones were crying and hugging each other for some time. When Aurora finally looked, Nick was gone.

<!-- {"status":"Rough","pov":"","description":"","location":"","analytic_info":{}} -->

The car pulled off from the one-lane road and onto the forest access road. The tires crunched on the gravel of the road, and they rolled forward a short distance and came to a stop.

Aurora put the car into Park and then turned the engine off. Silence took the car.

She looked to the right, where Lily sat in the passenger seat. Lily was human-sized, strapped into the car seat with a seatbelt. They had been driving for two hours in companionable silence. They were now well into the forests north of the city of Duncan. Aurora suspected that Lily had her powers back and would shrink to normal size soon.

She took a moment to take in the lines of the pixie’s face. Her short, dark hair and pale face, marked by the curling black tattoos around her left eye. She had intended to ask what they meant. Solon had been tattooed from face to feet.

“Do you know where you’re going?” Aurora asked.

“I’ll have to look for a bit,” Lily said. “I’ve never been here. I don’t imagine it will be too hard.”

“Your people aren’t exactly easy to find,” objected Aurora.

“For big people,” said Lily.

She undid her seatbelt. She lifted the bag from her feet that held the few things that Lily had retrieved from the home she had shared with Solon. Everything else had been burned to remove all traces. Lily was never going back.

They both got out of Aurora’s mom’s car. Aurora hadn’t explained where she was going, but she had the car for the day. Her mom would never have believed her if she’d said she needed it to deliver a pixie to her new home up island.

Aurora looked around at the surrounding forest. It was very similar to the one behind her house. The climate here was almost the same as Victoria. But here the forest extended for hundreds of kilometers.

“You know, you could travel by forest from here all the way to Port Renfrew,” Aurora noted idly.

“I don’t think I’ll do that.” There was a bitter note to Lily’s voice.

“It’ll be okay,” said Aurora.

“For some time,” said Lily. “But the basic forces haven’t changed. They chased us from our home in the old country. And now from Victoria.” Her shoulders slumped.

“Maybe,” said Lily. “But you can’t hide forever. Almost every human has an HD-quality camera on them at all times, now. Mr. Beattie was right, you know. There’s so much to learn from each other.”

“He gave his word,” said Lily.

“Yes, he did, but he will be here and visiting the faeries soon enough. You can count on it.”

“We’ll watch for him,” said Lily. There was a tone of hope.

“I’ll see you again,” said Aurora.

“I know you will,” said Lily. They hugged. Then Aurora let her friend go and wiped a stray tear from her cheek.

Lily shrank down to her normal size and her wings thrummed to life. She spiralled upwards to the tops of the trees, and then flew out of her sight.

Aurora waited for a bit in case she came back, but she didn’t. She got back into the car and started the drive home.

THE END
