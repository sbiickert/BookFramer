It is a truth <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">universally</mark> acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9"><mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">However</mark> little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">is <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">well</mark> fixed</mark> in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>me one or other of their daughters.</mark>

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">is let</mark> at last?”

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">Long</mark> has <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">just</mark> been here, and she told me all about it.”

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">impatiently</mark>.

“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”

This was invitation <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">enough</mark>.

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">Long</mark> says that Netherfield <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">is taken</mark> by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">immediately</mark>; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>me of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”</mark>

“What is his name?”

“Bingley.”

“Is he married or single?”

“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”

“How <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>? How can it affect them?”

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> tire<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>me! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”

“Is that his design in settling here?”

“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>! But it is <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">therefore</mark> you must visit him as <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3"><mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>on</mark> as he comes.”

“I see no occasion for that. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">perhaps</mark> will be <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">still</mark> better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”</mark>

“My dear, you flatter me. <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">I</mark> certa<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>nly have had my share of beauty, but <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">I</mark> do not pretend to be anyth<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>ng extraord<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>nary now. When a woman has f<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>ve grown-up daughters, she ought to g<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>ve over th<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>nk<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">i</mark>ng of her own beauty.”

“In such cases, a woman has not <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">often</mark> much beauty to think of.”

“But, my dear, you must <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">indeed</mark> go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”

“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”

“But consider your daughters. <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">Only</mark> think what an establishment it would be for one of them. <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">Sir William and Lady Lucas <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">are determined</mark> to go, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">merely</mark> on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers.</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">Indeed</mark> you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.”

“You are over-scrupulous, <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">surely</mark>. <mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">I dare say Mr. Bingley will be <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">very</mark> glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</mark>

“I desire you will do no such thing. <mark title="Sentence difficult to read" style="background-color: #f7ecb5">Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">is not half</mark> <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> hand<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>me as Jane, nor half <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> good-humoured as Lydia.</mark> But you are always giving her the preference.”

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">“They have none of them much to recommend them,<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">”</mark> replied he; “they are all <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">silly</mark> and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.<mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">”</mark></mark>

“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”

“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.”

“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”

“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”

“It will be <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">no</mark> use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">no</mark>t visit them.”

“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.”

<mark title="Sentence v. difficult to read" style="background-color: #e4b9b9">Mr. Bennet was <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark> odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.</mark> Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she <mark title="Passive voice" style="background-color: #c4ed9d">was discontented</mark>, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its <mark title="Adverb" style="background-color: #c4e3f3">so</mark>lace was visiting and news.
