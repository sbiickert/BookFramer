# BookFramer
 MacOS application for editing novels with BBEdit

An attempt at making a native Mac app that performs the same task as [PyBookBuilder](https://github.com/sbiickert/PyBookBuilder). At the moment, the entities are in a tested state, and the application can open "bfd" (BookFramer Document) files... that are just Markdown. OutlineView works and the detail views are showing up, in a debug state.
